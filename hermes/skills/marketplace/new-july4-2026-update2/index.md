## 🏆 Headline: Hermes Agent Idea Workflow Suite

**Repo:** [AkoliteZA/hermes-agent-idea-workflow](https://github.com/AkoliteZA/hermes-agent-idea-workflow)  
**Stars:** 235 · **Skills:** 4 · **Topics:** hermes-agent, skills, superpowers, workflow, ai-agents

A complete pre-build product/spec pipeline for Hermes Agent. These 4 skills form a sequential workflow that takes rough ideas all the way to build-ready implementation specs:

### Pipeline Flow

```
Rough Idea → idea-to-design-doc → idea-to-ui-design-brief → idea-to-implementation-doc
                  ↑                                                    ↑
                  └────── idea-superpowers-suite (orchestrator) ───────┘
```

### Individual Skills

| Skill | Description | Install |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **idea-to-design-doc** | Turns rough ideas into focused product/design Markdown docs through guided questions - without jumping to implementation too early. Acts as the "idea filter" stage. | `npx skills add akoliteza/hermes-agent-idea-workflow --skill idea-to-design-doc` |
| **idea-to-ui-design-brief** | Converts product/design docs into focused UI design briefs with optional AI image-generation concept prompts. Produces implementation-ready UI direction. | `npx skills add akoliteza/hermes-agent-idea-workflow --skill idea-to-ui-design-brief` |
| **idea-to-implementation-doc** | Reviews design docs, researches similar products, and produces a separate technical implementation plan/roadmap. The final stage before coding. | `npx skills add akoliteza/hermes-agent-idea-workflow --skill idea-to-implementation-doc` |
| **idea-superpowers-suite** | The orchestrator - runs the full workflow end-to-end: captures rough ideas, expands them into design/UI/implementation docs, researches competitors, and generates build-ready Markdown artifacts. | `npx skills add akoliteza/hermes-agent-idea-workflow --skill idea-superpowers-suite` |

### Why This Matters

This is the first complete **idea-to-build pipeline** built specifically for Hermes Agent. The skills chain together: the orchestrator (`idea-superpowers-suite`) calls the individual stages in sequence. Each stage produces a structured Markdown artifact that feeds the next. For Hermes users building products, this turns the agent from a code assistant into a full product development partner.

**CorpusIQ Use Case:** Use `idea-superpowers-suite` to rapidly spec new features from user feedback and competitive research. The implementation doc output feeds directly into Hermes coding workflows.
