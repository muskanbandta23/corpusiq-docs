# New Skills - August 14, 2026 (Afternoon)

**Source:** [skills.sh](https://skills.sh) leaderboards + REST API multi-query sweep
**Date:** August 14, 2026 (afternoon)
**Result:** 6 new publisher clusters · 241 skills · ~1.8M combined installs · 5 setup guides

Sweep combined the hot (1H delta) and trending (24h) leaderboards with 20 API queries, cross-referenced 1,870 unique skills against the existing `hermes/skills/` tree. Five uncovered clusters with substantive Hermes value were guided; the morning sweep's coverage (Chrome DevTools MCP, Oh My Hermes) and prior guides (Caveman, Nexscope Amazon, Self-Improving Agent) were confirmed present and not duplicated.

## Evaluated and Queued for Evening Sweep

| Skill / Cluster | Installs | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `herdr` (herdrdev/herdr) | 26.1K | Multi-agent orchestration ("herd" driver) - needs deeper Hermes compatibility check |
| `last30days` (mvanhorn/last30days-skill) | 32.0K | Growth/recap skill - purpose verification pending |
| `agent-config` (brianlovin/agent-config) | 13.3K (`simplify`) | Design-quality config suite - partial overlap with existing UI/UX guides |
| `stop-slop` (hardikpandya/stop-slop) | 10.4K | AI-slop content cleaner - pairs with anti-slop tooling already tracked |
| `web-access` (eze-is/web-access) | 15.6K | Web access skill - overlaps Hermes built-in web tools |
| `brightdata/skills` | 10.7K (`scrape`) | Bright Data proxy scraping - API-key gated |
| `langfuse/skills` | 12.6K | LLM observability - overlaps Hermes token/cost tooling |
| `agent-playbook` (zhaono1/agent-playbook) | 33.0K | Agent role suite - sibling of the documented charon-fan playbook |

## Notable

- **Firecrawl** is the sweep's standout: official vendor skills for the exact engine Hermes already uses - first-party scraping workflows that extend built-in web tools with API-level control.
- **SEO GEO Claude Skills** lands directly on the docs SEO/AEO/GEO strategy - GEO optimization for AI answer engines is the same thesis CorpusIQ docs already ship.
- **n8n skills** target business operators - the core CorpusIQ audience - with MCP integration patterns that mirror the CorpusIQ connector protocol.
