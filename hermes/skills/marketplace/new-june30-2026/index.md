## Why These Matter

**OpenClaw is maturing fast.** The ecosystem jumped from infrastructure skills to domain-specific tooling - financial data, medical knowledge, quantitative analysis. This signals a shift from "can it run?" to "what can it do?"

**MCP development tooling is consolidating.** Anthropic's official build-mcp-* trio (3,000+ installs each) + mcp-deploy-manage-agents (8,667) + mcp-security-audit (800) form a complete MCP development lifecycle: build → deploy → manage → audit. Any Hermes agent that connects to MCP servers benefits from these.

**Platform diversity continues.** Clawdbot skills from Volces (ByteDance cloud) show the Hermes/OpenClaw agent model spreading to non-Western cloud platforms.
