## 🔑 Standout Finds

### neondatabase/agent-skills (75K+ installs, 81⭐)
The highest-install serverless database platform on skills.sh. The neon-postgres skill alone has 56.8K installs - more than any other database platform's single skill. Neon's database branching model (per-task isolated database copies) is uniquely suited to agent workflows. The AI Gateway skill provides one-API-key routing between Claude, GPT, Gemini, and open-source models - directly complementing CorpusIQ's multi-model strategy.

### anthropics/skills (52.6K installs, 164,242⭐)
The most-starred skills repository documented to date at 164K stars - surpassing all previously catalogued repos combined. While skills.sh only surfaces the `claude-api` skill, the GitHub repository is Anthropic's primary skills distribution channel for Claude Code. This is the definitive Claude API reference that should be loaded by any Hermes agent using Claude as a backend model.

### figma/mcp-server-guide (23K+ installs, 1,809⭐)
The bridge between design and code. The `implement-design` skill at 6K installs enables agents to read Figma designs and generate production code - closing the design-development gap. `figma-code-connect` enables bidirectional design-code synchronization, a capability unique to Figma among skills.sh publishers.

## Other Highlights

- **grafana/skills** (16K installs): Full observability stack - dashboards, PromQL, Loki, Mimir, Pyroscope, Beyla. The `assistant-mcp` skill enables natural language queries of observability data. Directly applicable to CorpusIQ's agent infrastructure monitoring.
- **planetscale/database-skills** (15K installs): The most balanced dual-database skills (MySQL 6.5K + Postgres 6.2K). Vitess is the only database sharding skill on skills.sh. Neki represents the emerging "agent-native" database tooling category.

## Discovery Method

Post-enterprise-sweep publisher scan: following the July 26 enterprise publisher sweep (Cloudflare, AWS, Google, HashiCorp, MongoDB, Databricks), this update targeted design, observability, and database platform publishers that had been missed. Used `npx skills find` with owner-scoped searches across 30+ additional publishers. Cross-referenced against 316 existing catalog entries. Confirmed 5 new publishers not previously catalogued.

Publishers checked but deprioritized: Netlify (7.8K, low stars), HuggingFace (8K, specialized ML), Qdrant (2.7K, niche), WorkOS (1.8K, niche), Weaviate (331, low installs), Liveblocks (758, low).

## Notes

- **anthropics/skills** at 164K GitHub stars is an outlier - Anthropic uses GitHub as their primary skills distribution, so the 52.6K skills.sh installs dramatically undercount actual usage
- **neon-postgres** (56.8K) surpasses even Supabase's individual skills - Neon has quietly become the most-installed database platform on skills.sh
- **figma/mcp-server-guide** is the only design-to-code skills publisher - unique positioning that no competitor covers
- **grafana/skills** is the only observability platform with agent skills - monitoring, logging, tracing, and profiling in one repo
- **planetscale/database-skills** offers the most balanced MySQL+Postgres coverage of any database platform
- 321 catalog entries now exist (up from 316 after this sweep)
- This sweep used `npx skills find` CLI tool instead of web search (Firecrawl unavailable) - validate with web search when Firecrawl is restored
