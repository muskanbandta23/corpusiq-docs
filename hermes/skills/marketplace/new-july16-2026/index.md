## agent-browser

**Source:** [vercel-labs/agent-browser](https://github.com/vercel-labs/agent-browser) · **38,590⭐** · **Rust + Node.js**

Fast native Rust CLI for browser automation, purpose-built for AI agents. Uses Chrome for Testing with accessibility-tree-based interaction (snap + refs) plus traditional CSS selectors. No Playwright or Node.js runtime dependency for the daemon. Install via npm, Homebrew, or Cargo.

### Capabilities
- **Accessibility snapshots:** `agent-browser snapshot` returns tree with refs (@e1, @e2...)
- **Ref-based interaction:** Click, fill, and get text using accessibility refs - no selectors needed
- **Traditional selectors:** CSS selector support for direct element targeting
- **JavaScript evaluation:** Execute arbitrary JS in page context
- **Daemon mode:** Persistent browser sessions across multiple operations
- **Screenshots:** Full-page and viewport capture

### Installation
```bash
npm install -g agent-browser
agent-browser install
```

### Hermes/CorpusIQ Relevance
Massive for competitive research, social media monitoring, and web scraping. The accessibility-tree approach means agents don't need to build fragile CSS selectors - they can work with semantic element refs that survive DOM changes. At 38K stars, this is the most popular agent-specific browser tool.
