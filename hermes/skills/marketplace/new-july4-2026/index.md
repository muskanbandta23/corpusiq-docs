## Category Breakdown

### Session Management (1 project)

#### agent-sessions (683⭐) ⭐ Setup Guide Available

**Repo:** [jazzyalex/agent-sessions](https://github.com/jazzyalex/agent-sessions)
**Author:** jazzyalex
**Language:** Swift
**Platform:** macOS (native)

Local-first macOS app to browse, search, analyze, and resume supported AI coding-agent session histories. Works with Hermes Agent, Claude Code, Codex, and Cursor. All session data stays local - no cloud sync, no telemetry.

**Key features:**
- Browse session history across multiple agent runtimes
- Full-text search across all conversation history
- Resume sessions from any supported agent
- Analyze conversation patterns and agent behavior
- Local-first - all data stays on device
- Native SwiftUI macOS app

**Setup Guide:** [agent-sessions - Full Setup Guide](/hermes/skills/catalog/agent-sessions-setup/)

```bash
# Download from GitHub Releases
# https://github.com/jazzyalex/agent-sessions/releases

# Or build from source:
git clone https://github.com/jazzyalex/agent-sessions.git
cd agent-sessions
open agent-sessions.xcodeproj
```

**Why this matters:** Agent session management is the missing piece in most agent workflows. When you run 50+ sessions across Hermes, Claude Code, and Codex in a week, finding "that one session where we fixed the gateway" becomes a needle-in-a-haystack problem. agent-sessions solves this with a unified, searchable, local-first browser. At 683 stars, the community agrees this is essential infrastructure.

## Why These Matter for Hermes Users

### Session Management Goes Mainstream
**agent-sessions** (683⭐) signals that the community is ready for production-grade session tooling. Browsing, searching, and resuming sessions across multiple agent runtimes is no longer a nice-to-have - it's infrastructure.

### Domain Specialization Accelerates
This sweep shows Hermes skills penetrating specific domains: academic research (arXiv Agent), hardware/IoT (Meshtastic adapter, omnilimb), health (Apollo), and design (cinematic-scroll). The ecosystem is growing beyond general-purpose coding agents into specialized vertical tools.

### Cognitive Architecture Emerges
**mark-heartflow-skill** and **hermes-agent-self-evolution** represent a new category: skills that modify HOW Hermes thinks, not just WHAT it can do. Multi-path judgment, self-correcting RL, genetic optimization - these are meta-skills that improve the agent itself.

### Multi-Agent Coordination
**tale** (13⭐) and **memoria-vault** (4⭐) both deploy multiple coordinated agents. The pattern is clear: single agents are giving way to agent teams with specialized roles and orchestration layers.

---
