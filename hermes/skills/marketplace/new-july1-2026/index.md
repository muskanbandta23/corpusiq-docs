## Category Breakdown

### Developer Utilities (11 official Hermes skills)

These 11 skills from the official `nousresearch/hermes-agent` repo fill important gaps in our catalog. They cover email (himalaya), content monitoring (blogwatcher), deployment (cloudflare-temporary-deploy), coding delegation (codex), desktop automation (computer-use), creative tools (creative-ideation), publishing (here.now), memory (honcho), personalization (petdex), academic writing (research-paper-writing), and Chinese platform integration (yuanbao).

**Key finds:**
- **honcho** - Cross-session memory is the backbone of persistent agent identity. This skill was inexplicably missing from the catalog.
- **blogwatcher** - RSS/Atom feed monitoring enables automated content discovery without API keys.
- **himalaya** - Terminal-based email is essential for headless agent email operations.
- **petdex** - Animated mascots add personality to the agent experience.

### Hermes Ecosystem (23 skills)

The `aradotso/hermes-skills` repo is a dedicated community hub for Hermes Agent extensions. These 23 skills span agent infrastructure (control room, mission control, self-evolution), desktop interfaces (macOS native client, HUD UI), integrations (Obsidian kanban, Feishu streaming), and education (ecosystem maps, edu skills).

**Key finds:**
- **hermes-agent-self-evolution** - Autonomous improvement patterns for Hermes agents
- **hermes-labyrinth-observability** - Production-grade monitoring for agent deployments
- **hermes-desktop-os1-native-macos-client** - Full native macOS Hermes experience
- **deepseek-openclaw-integration** - Integration for DeepSeek models with agent operations

### Security (15 ClawSec skills)

The `prompt-security/clawsec` repo provides the first comprehensive security toolkit for agent ecosystems. While targeting Claw/OpenClaw, the prompt injection detection, supply chain verification, and traffic monitoring are universally applicable to Hermes deployments.
