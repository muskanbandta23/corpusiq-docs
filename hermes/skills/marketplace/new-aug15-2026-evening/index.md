# New Skills - August 15, 2026 (Evening Sweep)

Fourth skills.sh sweep of August 15. 40 API queries collected 3,944 unique skills; cross-referenced against the hermes/ tree with the newest batch-page dirs excluded, then re-verified the entire carry-over queue on publisher pages. The dominant pattern again was **queue underestimation**: getsentry 20.7K → 85.3K, emblemcompany 8.8K → 78.6K, cloudai-x 7.9K → 80.0K, ljagiello → 71.6K (never counted before). Every queued candidate was re-verified per the stale-assessment rule before drafting or re-parking.

## New Publisher Clusters - Guided This Sweep

## Method Notes

- 40 API queries → 3,944 unique skills → top-120 clusters all present in the tree → same-day triage recovery excluded `new-aug15-2026*` dirs → 5 not-guided candidates → carry-over queue re-verified on publisher pages (17 fetches) → 11 clusters drafted, 7 parked, 4 dropped.
- Single-skill audit tiers: motion-design 🟢 (3/3 Pass), mobile-app-ui-design 🟢 (3/3 Pass), deep-research 🟡 (Snyk Warn). Multi-skill suites tiered by publisher: official vendor orgs (Sentry, Bright Data, Langfuse, Mintlify, LottieFiles) 🟢; community or crypto-adjacent publishers 🟡.
- resend/react-email and resend/email-best-practices surfaced in the re-diff but were skipped - `resend-skills-setup.md` already covers the family.
- Hot leaderboard (1H delta) added watch candidates: alibaba/open-code-review (4.3K), asksurf-ai/surf-skills (3.8K), streakyc/googleworkspacecli (1.7K), uni-stack/uniwind (5.3K).

## Evaluated and Queued (next sweep)

| Cluster | Installs | Reason parked |
|---|---|---|
| uni-stack/uniwind | 5.3K | RN tooling, at bar; watch next sweep |
| amazonappdev/devices-agent-skills | 5.1K | Fire TV migration niche |
| alibaba/open-code-review | 4.3K | Below bar; brand authority watch |
| asksurf-ai/surf-skills | 3.8K | Below bar |
| ningzimu/codex-ppt-skill | 3.5K | Below bar |
| dmmulroy/anti-slop | 1.1K | Below bar |
| zhaono1/agent-playbook | 50.3K | Top skill (self-improving-agent, 33.0K) already guided via charon-fan; remaining 23 skills ≤1.2K each |

Dropped below minimum: sonilo-ai/skills (234), algolia/skills (235), tencentmusic/qqmusic-skills (714), jimliu/baocut (181).

Carry-over queue remains parked per playbook: herdr, last30days, agent-config, stop-slop, web-access.

## Notable Signals for CorpusIQ

- **Sentry's suite** is the strongest security + code-review skill cluster catalogued to date - a natural pairing for our GitHub work and the PR security gate.
- **Bright Data's competitive-intel, brand-listening, and seo-audit** skills map one-to-one onto our research and SEO operations; scrape/search are a resilient fallback path for degraded search backends.
- **Langfuse tracing** addresses the exact gap our multi-model operation has: attribute cost per model and debug agent loops.
- **The video toolkit** (ffmpeg, remotion, elevenlabs) overlaps the same primitives our UGC pipeline runs on - a reference for pipeline hardening.
- **CTF skills** give a structured offensive-security checklist for authorized testing, plus OSINT methodology we can reuse for research.
