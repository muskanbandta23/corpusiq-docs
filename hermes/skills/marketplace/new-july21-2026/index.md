- **skill-vetter** from useai-pro (20.5K installs) is distinct from the existing `skill-vetting-setup` which covers the NVIDIA SkillSpector-based system from SoCalStreet.
- **firecrawl-agent** (73.9K installs) extends the existing Firecrawl catalog with AI-powered structured extraction, complementing `firecrawl-workflows-setup`.
