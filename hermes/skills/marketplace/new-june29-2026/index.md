## Skill Details

### 1. Coding Posture (9★)
**Repo:** [alexei-led/coding-posture](https://github.com/alexei-led/coding-posture)

A single `SKILL.md` that gives coding agents task-aware working modes - debug, fix, review, migrate, explain, and test. The agent adjusts its reasoning depth, tool selection, and output format based on the active posture. Works across Hermes, Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, and Pi.

**Why it matters:** Eliminates the need to write "be thorough" or "just give me a quick fix" in every prompt. The agent knows what mode it's in.

```bash
npx skills add alexei-led/coding-posture
```

---

### 2. Ultimate Humanizer (1★)
**Repo:** [surdijon/ultimate-humanizer](https://github.com/surdijon/ultimate-humanizer)

Anti-AI-slop detection: 50 patterns, 2-pass self-audit, and 5-dimensional scoring (naturalness, variety, agency, specificity, rhythm). Optimized for French but works across languages. Includes Google spam-protection mode for SEO content.

**Why it matters:** Every AI-generated text carries patterns that readers - and search engines - increasingly detect. Ultimate Humanizer strips them systematically.

```bash
npx skills add surdijon/ultimate-humanizer
```

---

### 3. Clean Slate
**Repo:** [sidhartha1s/clean-slate](https://github.com/sidhartha1s/clean-slate)

Session-end verification that turns "looks done" into proven done. Audits every agent claim - merged PRs, passing tests, fixed bugs - against the real artifact. Produces a structured status report with ✅, ⚠️, and ❌ verdicts.

**Why it matters:** The #1 failure mode of coding agents is claiming completion without verification. Clean Slate makes verification automatic.

```bash
npx skills add sidhartha1s/clean-slate
```

---

### 4. Delegate Skills
**Repo:** [bassemZohdy/delegate-skills](https://github.com/bassemZohdy/delegate-skills)

Spawn background agent workers in isolated git worktrees. The parent agent continues working while background workers handle long-running tasks - with self-healing monitoring that restarts failed workers.

**Why it matters:** True parallel agent work without context pollution. One agent handles the conversation while workers handle the heavy lifting.

```bash
npx skills add bassemZohdy/delegate-skills
```

---

### 5. AutoLoRA (1★)
**Repo:** [DJLougen/autolora](https://github.com/DJLougen/autolora)

Hermes fine-tunes itself. Curates successful agent traces, trains a LoRA adapter on RunPod via Unsloth, and hot-swaps the improved model - all while keeping costs capped via Stripe payment thresholds.

**Why it matters:** This is the self-improving agent loop made real. The agent gets better at your specific workflows over time.

```bash
npx skills add DJLougen/autolora
```

---

### 6. Hermes WhatsApp Secretary
**Repo:** [ricktechmecha/hermes-whatsapp-secretary](https://github.com/ricktechmecha/hermes-whatsapp-secretary)

Read, summarize, draft replies, and schedule WhatsApp messages - all through Hermes. Every reply requires your confirmation before sending. Priority filtering for important contacts.

**Why it matters:** WhatsApp is where business happens for many operators. This brings it into the agent workflow with appropriate safety gates.

```bash
npx skills add ricktechmecha/hermes-whatsapp-secretary
```

---

### 7. Safari Web Agent (1★)
**Repo:** [treyxu23/safari-web-agent](https://github.com/treyxu23/safari-web-agent)

Browser automation using your real Safari browser via native macOS CGEvent. Anti-bot bypass, login session persistence, and real browser fingerprint. Works on sites where Playwright gets detected.

**Why it matters:** Many business tools and dashboards block headless browsers. Safari Web Agent navigates them as a real user.

```bash
npx skills add treyxu23/safari-web-agent
```
