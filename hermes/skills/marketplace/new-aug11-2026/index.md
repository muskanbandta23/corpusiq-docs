## Skill Details

### 1. songwriting-and-ai-music (324 installs)
Official Hermes Agent creative skill for AI-assisted songwriting. Provides song structure templates (ABABCB, AABA, ABAB, AAA), lyrical composition guidelines, and integration hooks for AI music generation tools like Suno and Udio. Art-forward philosophy: guidelines, not rules.

### 2. debugging-hermes-tui-commands (76 installs)
Essential developer tool for diagnosing TUI slash command issues across Hermes' three-layer architecture (Python registry → JSON-RPC gateway → Ink/TypeScript frontend). Covers autocomplete debugging, layer desync detection, and new command registration walkthrough.

### 3. hermes-attestation-guardian (94 installs)
Security verification skill from prompt-security/clawsec. Performs release artifact verification, checksum validation against ClawSec release keys, SBOM inspection, runtime attestation, and trust chain verification for Hermes infrastructure components.

### 4. research-paper-writing (396 installs)
End-to-end ML/AI research paper pipeline targeting NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, ACL, AAAI, and COLM. Covers experiment design, execution, monitoring, analysis, paper writing, review response, and camera-ready submission. Originally from master-cai/research-paper-writing-skills.

### 5. plan (309 installs)
Plan Mode switches Hermes into planning-only execution. Generates structured markdown plans saved to `.hermes/plans/` but does NOT implement code, run mutating commands, or perform external actions. Ideal for architecture reviews and stakeholder alignment.
