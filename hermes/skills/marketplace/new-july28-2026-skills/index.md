## Why This Matters for Hermes

These six skills fill critical gaps in the Hermes ecosystem. `dogfood` brings systematic QA testing - essential as Hermes agents increasingly drive production workflows. `skill-vetter` addresses the growing security surface area of the skills marketplace at 20.6K installs. `openclaw-backup` solves agent state persistence with encryption. The three community Hermes skills (`hermes-imports`, `hermes-history-ingest`, `hermes-marketing-dashboard`) demonstrate the maturing operator toolchain around Hermes - workflow export, knowledge mining, and marketing ops.
