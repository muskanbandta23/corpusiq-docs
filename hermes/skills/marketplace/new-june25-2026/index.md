| **frontmatter-guard** | 109 | Validate and auto-repair YAML frontmatter on brain pages. Catches malformed metadata before it corrupts the knowledge base. |

## Mid-Value Tier (50-99 installs)

| Skill | Installs | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **book-mirror** | 96 | Take any book (EPUB/PDF), produce personalized chapter-by-chapter analysis with two-column tables mapping ideas to the reader's life using brain context. |
| **strategic-reading** | 92 | Read content through a specific strategic problem lens, producing an applied playbook mapping insights to decisions. |
| **academic-verify** | 92 | Verify research claims by tracing publication → methodology → raw data → independent replication. Routes through multiple verification layers. |
| **perplexity-research** | 90 | Brain-augmented web research. Sends brain context to Perplexity, returns what is NEW vs what the brain already knows. |
| **article-enrichment** | 89 | Transform raw article dumps into structured pages with executive summary, key insights, and why-it-matters analysis. |
| **brain-pdf** | 89 | Generate publication-quality PDF from any brain page via gstack make-pdf binary. Strips YAML frontmatter, applies headers and formatting. |
| **concept-synthesis** | 89 | Deduplicate and synthesize raw concept stubs into a tiered intellectual map (T1 Canon to T4 Riff), tracing idea evolution across sources. |
| **archive-crawler** | 89 | Universal archivist for personal file archives (Dropbox, B2, Gmail takeout, local mounts). Filters for high-value user-authored content. |
| **voice-note-ingest** | 88 | Ingest voice notes with exact-phrasing preservation. Routes content to proper brain categories (concepts, people, companies, ideas). |
| **ask-user** | 81 | Reusable pattern for presenting the user with explicit choices and gating decisions that require human judgment. |
| **functional-area-resolver** | 72 | Compress an agent's routing file (RESOLVER.md) by converting functional area mappings into compact decision trees. |

| **schema-author** | 55 | Evolve the brain's schema pack: add page types, propose new ones from corpus scans, backfill page.type, audit pack health. |
| **eiirp** | 55 | "Everything In Its Right Place" - universal post-work organizer that files output into proper brain locations after any task. |
| **brain-taxonomist** | 55 | Filing gate for ALL brain writes. Consulted before creating any new page to ensure proper taxonomy placement. |
| **schema-unify** | 47 | Migrate a brain from gbrain-base to gbrain-base-v2's 14-canonical-type taxonomy via the unify-types Minion handler. |
| **skill-optimizer** | 40 | Self-evolving skill optimization via SkillOpt-paper-grounded text-space optimizer. Improves skills based on usage patterns. |
| **gbrain-upgrade** | 31 | Keep gbrain current. Automatically detects version drift and runs upgrade sequences with rollback protection. |
| **idea-lineage** | 26 | Trace one idea's evolution through the brain: first mention, best articulation, current state, and derivative concepts. |
