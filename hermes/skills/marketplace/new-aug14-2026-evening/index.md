## Notable

- **Official vendor wave:** three of the eight clusters are first-party vendor skills (Flutter, Sentry, CodeRabbit) - the marketplace is shifting from community experiments to vendor-published agent capabilities.
- **ECC is the largest single-repo suite yet cataloged** (292 skills, 466.2K installs), spanning engineering, research, content, and agent governance in one package.
- **Pexo lands directly on the CorpusIQ media stack** - Seedance/Veo prompters plus short-form ad skills complement HeyGen, HyperFrames, and Postiz pipelines.
- **SEOJuice + the afternoon's SEO GEO Claude Skills** give the docs SEO/AEO/GEO pass two complete, complementary toolkits.
