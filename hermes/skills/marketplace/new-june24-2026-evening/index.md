### 1. ContextForge RAG - Installable Hermes Profile (codegraphtheory)

A complete Hermes Agent profile for production RAG architecture - not just a single skill, but a full agent identity bundle. Built from the `hermes-profile-template`.

**Bundles 5 skills:** principal-ai-architect, technical-roadmapping, production-rag-architecture, rag-evaluation-observability, agentic-workflow-issue-factory.

Install with: `hermes profile install github.com/codegraphtheory/context-forge-rag --name context-forge-rag --yes`

**Why it matters:** First Hermes Agent *profile* (not skill) discovered. Represents a new distribution pattern - full agent identities as installable packages. MIT licensed.

---

### 2. Math via Code - Zero Arithmetic Errors (tommulkins)

Hard rule: all arithmetic with 3+ numbers goes through code execution. Born from repeated financial modeling errors where LLM in-head math produced wrong numbers on SDE, P&L, and facility rollups.

**Why it matters:** Directly applicable to CorpusIQ's business operator use case. Every financial calculation in lead qualification, pricing analysis, and growth metrics should route through this skill. MIT licensed.

---

### 3. Hermes Memory Stack - Memory OS Layer (Chukwuemeka001)

228 tests across 4 remediation areas + semantic retrieval + auto-extraction + temporal versioning. The most comprehensive memory solution found in the ecosystem to date.

**Components:** semantic session search, conservative auto-extraction, temporal versioning, state.db remediation, MEMORY.md audit, pointer rewrite, temporal migration.

**Why it matters:** Addresses a universal Hermes Agent pain point - memory overload and state.db bloat. 19KB README with production-ready tooling. Apache-2.0 licensed.

---

### 4. Loop Maker - Cross-Harness Loop Scaffolding (EricTechPro)

7-question wizard that interviews you and outputs a ready-to-run loop folder (SKILL.md + STATE.md + verifier.py + stop conditions). Works across Claude Code, Codex, Hermes, and OpenClaw.

**Key differentiator from Perfectloop:** Cross-harness portability. If you're building loops that need to run on multiple agent platforms, Loop Maker's abstract tool references handle it.

**Why it matters:** Complements Perfectloop for quick prototyping scenarios. MIT licensed.

---

### 5. Skill Repo Manager + Skywork Skills Hub (Victor-F-M-A-R)

Two-part system:
- **Skill Repo Manager:** Sync, audit, and manage Hermes skill repos with 3 scripts
- **Skywork Skills Hub:** Monorepo bundling 18 Hermes skills as Git submodules

The hub includes skills for: animations, architecture design, artifacts building, content marketing, PRD creation, data science, design extraction, frontend design, marketing psychology, short drama writing, stock market analysis, APA papers, business analysis reports, competitive analysis, legal agreements, web design, YouTube watching, and repo management.

**Why it matters:** Largest single-author Hermes skill collection discovered (18 skills). The submodule pattern is novel - enables monorepo-style management of distributed skill repos.
