## Skill Highlights

### heartmula - Open-Source Suno Alternative (224 installs)
Apache 2.0 licensed music generation. Four-model pipeline: HeartMuLa generates from lyrics + tags, HeartCodec decodes to audio, HeartTranscriptor transcribes vocals, HeartCLAP verifies style alignment. Runs locally, no API keys, full ownership of output.

### simplify-code - Four Parallel Code Reviewers (187 installs)
Cleanup pass with four concurrent reviewers: Reuse, Quality, Efficiency, Altitude. Each hunts its own problem class. Four reviewers, one review's latency. Complements `requesting-code-review` (bug hunt) with waste reduction.

### subagent-driven-development - Multi-Agent Task Dispatch (88 installs)
Fresh subagent per task with automated two-stage review. Consumes `plan` skill output. Clean context isolation prevents cross-task errors. Automated gating between steps.

### grounded-citations - Verifiable Source Chains (22 installs)
Low install count but high research integrity value. Perplexity-style inline citations with ledger-owned URL mapping. Verbatim quote verification. `verify --evidence` command. Integrates with `research-paper-writing` for academic pipelines.
