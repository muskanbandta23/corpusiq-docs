## Category Breakdown

### Software Engineering (1 skill)

#### improve-codebase-architecture (347,772 installs)
**Repo:** [mattpocock/skills](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills)

Scan a codebase for deepening opportunities, present them as a visual HTML report, then grill through whichever one you pick. Architecture review and improvement recommendations built for agent-driven refactoring.

```bash
npx skills add mattpocock/skills@improve-codebase-architecture
```

### Product Management (1 skill)

#### to-prd (308,668 installs)
**Repo:** [mattpocock/skills](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills)

Turn the current conversation into a PRD and publish it to the project issue tracker - no interview, just synthesis of what you've already discussed. Converts natural-language discussions into structured product requirement documents.

```bash
npx skills add mattpocock/skills@to-prd
```

### Project Management (1 skill)

#### to-issues (296,216 installs)
**Repo:** [mattpocock/skills](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills)

Break a plan, spec, or PRD into independently-grabbable issues on the project issue tracker using tracer-bullet vertical slices. Transforms high-level plans into executable, prioritized issue lists.

```bash
npx skills add mattpocock/skills@to-issues
```

### Infrastructure (1 skill)

#### setup-matt-pocock-skills (288,420 installs)
**Repo:** [mattpocock/skills](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills)

Configure the repo for the engineering skills - set up its issue tracker, triage label vocabulary, and domain doc layout. Run once before first use of the Matt Pocock engineering skill suite.

```bash
npx skills add mattpocock/skills@setup-matt-pocock-skills
```

### Planning & Critique (1 skill)

#### grilling (71,235 installs)
**Repo:** [mattpocock/skills](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills)

Interview the user relentlessly about a plan or design. Use when you want to stress-test a plan before building, or with any "grill" trigger phrases. Adversarial plan review that catches blind spots before implementation.

## Why These Matter

**Matt Pocock's engineering skills are the most-installed skills.sh suite** - 1.3M+ combined installs across 5 skills. They give Hermes agents production-grade software engineering workflows: architecture review → PRD generation → issue decomposition → adversarial critique. Any Hermes agent doing code work benefits from this pipeline.

**The gap between "assistant" and "engineer" is closing.** These skills replace human-driven code review, spec writing, and project management with agent-driven equivalents. The install counts (300K+ per skill) show real adoption, not experimental toy projects.

**OpenClaw skill management is becoming automated.** voltagent-openclaw-skill-loader (5,200+ skills from ClawHub) signals that OpenClaw's skill ecosystem is large enough to need programmatic management - not manual `npx skills add` one at a time.
