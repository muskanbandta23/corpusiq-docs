# New Skills - August 18, 2026 Evening

Evening sweep of August 18. The API surface stayed fully caught up (39 of 40 queries, 3,854 unique skills; the one email query timed out). The plain diff returned only two candidates, both noise (a superpowers fork whose family is already guided via obra, and PCL flagged only by the substring-match trap). The real batch came from hot-page triage of vendor clusters, following the steady-state pattern: hot-page owner triage plus publisher-page verification is the primary discovery channel.

## Method Notes

- anthropics/claude-for-legal surfaced from the hot page (amendment-history 1+1) and read 54.4K across 118 skills on its publisher page - official Anthropic, 9.2K GitHub stars, all three audits Pass on legal-writing.
- personamanagmentlayer/pcl came from the API diff (finance-expert 6.2K via API, 36.2K across 104 skills on the publisher page). Snyk Warn on finance-expert; 41 stars.
- vtex/skills surfaced on the hot page (marketplace-order-hook 1+1); publisher page reads 32.6K across 51 skills, official VTEX org, all three audits Pass.
- interfacex-co-jp/genshijin at #2 on the hot page (genshijin-commit 13+13 1H) with 19.2K across 7 skills; drafted below the 20K bar on hot momentum plus Japanese corporate publisher. SKILL.md content is Japanese - flagged in the guide per the wecomteam precedent.
- yusukebe/hono-skill at 11.7K on one skill; drafted below the bar on framework-author authority (Hono's creator). Snyk Warn.
- capawesome-team/skills at 11.4K across 37 skills; drafted below the bar on ecosystem-team authority (Capacitor plugin vendor). Snyk Fail on the flagship.
- wyattowalsh/agents at 2.1K across 85 skills; drafted below the bar on platform-founder authority (skills.sh's founder) and the unique skill-lifecycle governance category it covers (budget linter, compat matrix, quality dashboard, lifecycle manager). All three audits Pass on orchestrator.
- Mac Mini still unreachable - sweep ran entirely from the Spark canonical clone, push auth via gh auth token.
- Carried-over queue re-verified on this sweep's hot page and re-parked; five new queue entries added from this sweep's triage (see Evaluated and Queued).
