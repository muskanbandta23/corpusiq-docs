## 🔗 New Hermes Agent Repos (8)

### 1. Hermes A2A Bridge - Agent-to-Agent Protocol

**Repo:** [asimons81/hermes-a2a-bridge](https://github.com/asimons81/hermes-a2a-bridge)
**Stars:** ⭐0 | **Created:** June 27, 2026
**Python:** v3.11+ | **Protocol:** A2A v0.4.6

A local-first bridge for the Agent-to-Agent Protocol (HTTP+JSON subset). Lets Hermes discover named remote agents and exposes Hermes itself through an A2A-shaped surface. MCP lets agents use tools; A2A lets agents call other agents. This bridge gives Hermes the second half.

```bash
python -m pip install -e .
hermes plugins enable a2a-bridge
hermes a2a init
hermes a2a serve
```

**Why it matters:** First A2A implementation for Hermes Agent. Enables true multi-agent collaboration where Hermes can delegate to other agent instances across a network. Complements existing subagent/delegation patterns with a standardized protocol.

---

### 2. Hermes Flight Recorder - Autonomy Eval Harness

**Repo:** [zwright8/hermes-flight-recorder](https://github.com/zwright8/hermes-flight-recorder)
**Stars:** ⭐0 | **Created:** June 26, 2026
**License:** Not specified

A standalone adversarial eval harness for Hermes Agent runs. Converts run artifacts into normalized traces, scores against explicit autonomy boundaries, and renders static HTML reports. Includes training export with SFT/DPO/reward model views, scenario quality metrics, and evidence coverage reports.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zwright8/hermes-flight-recorder.git
cd hermes-flight-recorder
./demo.sh
open runs/index.html
```

**Why it matters:** Accountability infrastructure for autonomous agents. For CorpusIQ operators running autonomous growth workflows, this provides regression testing, boundary enforcement verification, and training data export for continuous improvement.

### 3. Robert Greene Skill - The 48 Laws of Power

**Repo:** [ooovenenoso/robert-greene-skill](https://github.com/ooovenenoso/robert-greene-skill)
**Stars:** ⭐4 | **Created:** June 26, 2026

Hermes Agent skill for The 48 Laws of Power. Cite any law by number, get law recommendations for a situation, and see complementary and contradictory laws. A unique domain-specific knowledge skill for strategic thinking.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ooovenenoso/robert-greene-skill.git
```

**Why it matters:** Highest-starred new skill of this sweep (⭐4). Demonstrates the pattern of loading book-level domain knowledge as installable agent skills - applicable to business strategy, negotiation, and leadership use cases.

### 4. Hermes ztk Integration - Context Token Compressor

**Repo:** [csx0574/hermes-ztk-integration](https://github.com/csx0574/hermes-ztk-integration)
**Stars:** ⭐0 | **Created:** June 26, 2026

Transparent ztk (shell output compressor) integration for Hermes Agent. Auto-wraps non-interactive commands, saving **60-99% context tokens**. Directly addresses one of the most expensive aspects of agent operation - shell output consuming context window.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/csx0574/hermes-ztk-integration.git
```

**Why it matters:** Direct cost optimization for CorpusIQ agents. Every shell command output that gets compressed saves real API costs. At 60-99% compression rates, this could significantly reduce per-session token consumption.
