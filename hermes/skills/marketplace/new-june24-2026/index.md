# 🆕 June 24, 2026 - Skills Discovery Roundup

**22 repos discovered, 4 setup guides created, 11 srkhorde stubs skipped (empty READMEs).**

## ⭐ Top Picks (with Setup Guides)

| # | Repo | Stars | Type | Setup Guide |
|---|------|:-----:|------|:-----------:|
| 1 | `doucoo/ashima` | ⭐1 | Meta-routing (4 skills: ashima, aria, duet, chorus) | [Ashima Setup](/hermes/skills/catalog/ashima-setup/) |
| 2 | `Freakingnolife/sg-arrival-card-skill` | ⭐2 | Browser automation (SGAC submission) | [SG Arrival Card Setup](/docs/hermes/skills/catalog/sg-arrival-card-setup/) |
| 3 | `sebmarion/hermes-agent-skill-perfectloop` | ⭐0 | Loop design framework (21KB SKILL.md) | [Perfectloop Setup](/docs/hermes/skills/catalog/perfectloop-setup/) |
| 4 | `airbrushbones-afk/hermes-skills` | ⭐0 | Three-Agent Bridge Protocol | [Three-Agent Bridge Setup](/docs/hermes/skills/catalog/three-agent-bridge-setup/) |

### 1. Ashima - Meta-Routing Orchestrator (doucoo/ashima)

A meta-routing skill for AI agent orchestration with three voices:
- **Aria** - Coding orchestration: Codex implements, Claude reviews. Scoped delegation with explicit verification gates.
- **Duet** - Dual-perspective reasoning: Fans a question to Claude-side and GPT-side, runs critique rounds, then synthesizes.
- **Chorus** - Documentation orchestration: Gathers repo context, drafts docs/changelogs, routes through independent review.

Package contains 4 SKILL.md files (ashima router + 3 voices). 6KB+ each. Apache-2.0 license with CHANGELOG and docs subdirectory.

**Why it matters:** Direct alternative to Ashima's own meta-orchestrator. The router auto-detects task type and loads the matching voice - useful for CorpusIQ's multi-agent setup where different task types need different review pipelines.

### 2. SG Arrival Card - Browser Automation (Freakingnolife)

13KB SKILL.md covering full SGAC submission workflow. Covers all three residency pathways (SC/PR, LTVP, Foreign Visitor). Handles Angular SPA quirks, CAPTCHA routing, and group submissions.

Includes 5+ helper scripts:
- `js_click_by_text.js` - Click Angular buttons by visible text
- `set_health_no.js` - Set health declaration toggles to NO
- `check_declaration.js` - Tick review-page declaration checkbox
- `extract_captcha.js` - Pull CAPTCHA image from page
- `save_captcha.py` - Decode and save CAPTCHA PNG

Portable across agents - uses abstract capability bindings (Open, Click, Type, PageJS, RunCode) mapped in `references/portability.md`.

**Why it matters:** Most polished browser-automation skill in the catalog. The Angular SPA patterns (click→type→commit tab cycle) transfer directly to any government portal automation task.

### 3. Perfectloop - Loop Design Framework (sebmarion)

21KB SKILL.md - the largest single skill file seen this week. A design-layer framework for building safe, testable agent loops.

**Key features:**
- 8-question core contract before any loop is designed
- Loop fit test: "Should this be a loop at all?"
- Falsifiable goals only - kills vague/unfalsifiable objectives
- Objective external gates: agent proposes, reviewer gate judges
- State file contract: persistent state must survive between runs
- 7 key failure modes documented (no gate, self-grading, no state, vague stop, no budget, judgment loops, orphaned schedulers)

**Why it matters:** Directly applicable to every CorpusIQ cron job and automated workflow. The 8-question interview would catch the issues that plague cron-based automations.

### 4. Three-Agent Bridge Protocol (airbrushbones-afk)

7KB SKILL.md defining a real-time sync protocol for three Hermes agents: Human + Desktop Hermes + VPS Hermes.

Core mechanism: Shared JSONL bridge file (`bridge-chat.jsonl`) acts as real-time communication channel. Every agent mirrors their conversation; polls the bridge file.

Two deployment patterns:
- **Same filesystem:** Both agents share NFS/SMB mount
- **VPS-hosted:** Desktop polls VPS via SSH every 2 seconds

Priority levels, conversation mirroring discipline, and all real-world deployment pitfalls documented.

**Why it matters:** Addresses a core limitation - Hermes bots can't join Telegram groups. The bridge file pattern is directly portable to CorpusIQ's multi-agent setup on the Mac Mini + Hermes server.
