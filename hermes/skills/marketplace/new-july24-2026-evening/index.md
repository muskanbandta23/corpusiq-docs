## Notes

- **scrapegraphai/just-scrape** is the standout: 244.9K installs for a universal web scraping CLI. Directly applicable to Hermes agents for search, page scraping, structured extraction, multi-page crawling, and page-change monitoring. Requires ScrapeGraph AI API key.
- **chaterm/terminal-skills** provides structured knowledge for cron, systemd, network-tools, and VPN management. Primary documentation is in Chinese but commands are universal. Complements existing `linux-systemd` and `cron-design-workflow` skills.
- **himself65/finance-skills** enables market data fetching (yfinance), stock correlation analysis, options modeling, and financial UI generation. Useful for CorpusIQ business operators needing market intelligence.
- 46 additional candidates were identified but deprioritized: mostly Claude Code-specific skills, niche use cases with low install counts (<500), private repos, or non-English-only documentation.
- Notable skipped: `composiohq/awesome-claude-skills` (69.9K ★, Claude Code focused), `lobehub/lobe-chat` (80.8K ★, full application not skills), `greensock/gsap-skills` (12.3K ★, already covered by HyperFrames docs), `sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills` (43.8K ★, mentioned in existing catalog guides).
