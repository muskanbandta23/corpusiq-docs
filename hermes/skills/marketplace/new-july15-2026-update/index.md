## openclaw-skill-vetter / openclaw-skill-vetter-1-0-0

**Source:** [skills.volces.com](https://skills.volces.com) · **168 + 171 installs** · Two versions of the same skill.

Automated skill quality validation - scans installed skills for common issues: missing dependencies, broken triggers, incompatible tool requirements, and security anti-patterns. The v1.0.0 variant includes stricter validation rules.

### Capabilities
- Dependency validation (checks all required tools are available)
- Trigger conflict detection (multiple skills with same keyword)
- Tool compatibility matrix checking
- Security anti-pattern scanning
- Skill structure validation (YAML frontmatter, required sections)
- Version compatibility checking (v1.0.0 only)

### Installation
```bash
# Standard version
npx skills add skills.volces.com/openclaw-skill-vetter

# Stricter v1.0.0 version
npx skills add skills.volces.com/openclaw-skill-vetter-1-0-0
```

### Hermes/CorpusIQ Relevance
