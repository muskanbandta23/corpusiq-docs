## ⭐ Standout Find: Threads Growth Skill (745 installs)

**Repo:** [aradotso/marketing-skills](https://github.com/aradotso/marketing-skills)
**Installs:** 745 | **Publisher:** aradotso (same org as hermes-skills, 50+ Hermes skills)

A Threads growth and marketing automation skill for Hermes agents. Part of the aradotso marketing-skills collection - the same publisher behind the hermes-skills ecosystem (50+ Hermes-native skills). Enables agents to execute Threads growth strategies, content scheduling, and audience engagement.

```bash
npx skills add aradotso/marketing-skills --skill threads-growth-skill
```

**Why it matters for CorpusIQ:** Directly applicable to CorpusIQ's growth operations. Threads is Meta's fastest-growing platform with 200M+ users. This skill lets Hermes agents execute Threads growth strategies autonomously - content publishing, engagement automation, and audience analytics. Combined with existing social media skills (X/Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram), this completes the Meta social stack.

**Why it matters:** NVIDIA's entry into the Hermes/OpenClaw skill ecosystem signals enterprise validation.

For CorpusIQ operators running production agent workflows, this provides a security baseline from a trusted enterprise vendor.
