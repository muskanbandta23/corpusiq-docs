## Category Breakdown

### Mobile & UX (1 project)

#### Hermex (286⭐) ⭐ Setup Guide Available

**Repo:** [uzairansaruzi/hermex](https://github.com/uzairansaruzi/hermex)
**Author:** Uzair Ansari (`@uzairansar`)
**App Store:** [Hermex on the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/hermex/id6767006319)
**Website:** [hermexapp.com](https://hermexapp.com)

Native SwiftUI iPhone app for driving a self-hosted Hermes agent. The phone is the control plane, not the compute plane - your agent, tools, and data stay on your own hardware. No subscriptions, no analytics, no third-party relay.

**Key features:**
- Real-time streaming chat with thinking + tool-call visibility
- Stop/steer agent runs mid-flight
- Browse, search, and resume sessions (offline-cached)
- Switch models, providers, profiles, and projects on the fly
- View/edit cron tasks and installed skills from your phone
- Workspace file browser for your server's filesystem
- Read-only memory and usage insights panels
- iOS 18+ native SwiftUI (not a web wrapper)

**Setup Guide:** [Hermex iPhone App - Full Setup Guide](/hermes/skills/catalog/hermex-iphone-app-setup/)

```bash
# Install from App Store
# https://apps.apple.com/app/hermex/id6767006319

# Or build from source:
git clone https://github.com/uzairansaruzi/hermex.git
cd hermex
open HermesMobile.xcodeproj
```

**Why this matters:** Hermex closes the mobile UX gap for Hermes. Previously, interacting with a self-hosted Hermes agent from your phone meant using a web browser pointed at Hermes Web UI. Hermex gives you a native experience - streaming, sessions, skills, tasks, workspace browsing - all in a polished SwiftUI app. At 286 stars in 24 hours, the community is voting loudly.

## Why These Matter for Hermes Users

### Hermex: The Mobile Control Plane
Until today, there was no native mobile experience for Hermes. Hermex changes that - and it does it with a polished, App Store-distributed SwiftUI app. For operators who want to check on their agents, review sessions, or kick off tasks from their phone, this is the missing piece.

### Ecosystem Maturation Signals
This sweep shows three healthy trends:
1. **Mobile expansion** - Hermex proves the Hermes ecosystem can support native mobile clients.
2. **Domain specialization** - Crypto Radar, n8n Workflow Engineer, and Obsidian plugin show the community building domain-specific Hermes extensions.
3. **Infrastructure innovation** - Da7-Tech/mind introduces cognitive memory models (spreading activation, Ebbinghaus forgetting) that push beyond simple key-value stores.

## Setup Guides Added

This sweep produced one detailed setup guide:
- **[Hermex iPhone App Setup](/hermes/skills/catalog/hermex-iphone-app-setup/)** - App Store install, server pairing, feature walkthrough, troubleshooting
