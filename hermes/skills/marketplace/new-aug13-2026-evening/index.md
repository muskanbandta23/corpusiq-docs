# New Skills - August 13, 2026 (Evening)

**Source:** [skills.sh](https://skills.sh) all-time + trending (24h) leaderboards
**Date:** August 13, 2026
**Result:** 12 new publisher clusters · 244 skills · 3.5M+ listed installs · 12 setup guides

The largest single-run sweep to date. Executed from the Spark node after the Mac Mini went offline (SSH timeout); the full leaderboard (top 600 all-time) was pulled, every publisher cross-referenced against the 413-entry catalog, and 12 undocumented clusters were guided. Headlined by Emil Kowalski's design-engineering suite (694K installs) and Convex's 46-skill backend platform pack (757K).

## Highlights

### Convex Agent Skills - 756.9K, 46 skills
The largest single-platform developer-experience cluster outside Microsoft Azure. Agents stand up a full TypeScript backend - schema, auth, crons, domains, billing, deploy guards - end to end. Twenty-nine expert sub-skills cover every lifecycle stage from `convex-quickstart` through `convex-self-heal` and `convex-launch-readiness`.

### Emil Kowalski Skills - 694.4K, 10 skills
The highest-signal design-quality layer on skills.sh, from the creator of Sonner. `emil-design-eng` (204K) plus a full motion-craft stack: review animations adversarially, improve them like a senior engineer, find where animation is missing, and pick the right UI library before writing code. The natural complement to `anti-ui-slop`.

### Wind Skills - 132.6K, 82 skills
China's Bloomberg-equivalent data terminal goes agent-native. `wind-mcp-skill` (93.8K) wires Wind's feeds into agents; 79 research workflows cover DCF models, valuation snapshots, backtests, earnings analysis, and investor-persona reasoning lenses (Buffett, Munger, Taleb, Naval). The strongest signal yet of institutional finance moving to agent-native tooling.

### OSINT Skills - 285.8K, 57 skills
The largest investigation cluster on skills.sh. Flagships verify media (`is-this-photo-real`, `find-the-original-image`) and audit personal exposure (`what-leaked-about-you`); the long tail covers domain recon, breach analysis, geolocation, crypto tracing, and intel-brief writing.

### Planning With Files - 90.5K, 7 skills
The ecosystem answer to context loss: persist task plans, findings, and decisions to disk so interrupted agents resume cleanly. Seven language editions including Simplified Chinese (16.8K) and a personal-intelligence variant.

## Still Pending (logged from prior sweeps)

- **fandhe-ai** and **novel-to-game** - not on current leaderboards; need direct publisher URL discovery
- **site/docs.stripe.com** - Stripe's site-registry skills (observed on the hot board: `connect-required-verification-information`); fetch `https://www.skills.sh/site/docs.stripe.com` next cycle
- **huaweicloud/huaweicloud-skills** - the full 82-skill cluster beyond the Flexus Hermes deployment guide already published
- Smaller zero-hit clusters not yet guided (install counts from all-time board): agentix-cloud (51.6K), huashu-design (42.6K), make-interfaces-feel-better (51K), momentic captured, nia (54.9K), pexo (39.4K), vue-best-practices (36.5K), fastify-best-practices (35K), hallmark (40.7K), design-doc-mermaid (33.4K), anysearch (~36K), hugmouse (35.5K), replicas (34.7K)

## Sweep Notes

- Mac Mini unreachable this cycle (SSH timeout); sweep ran fully from Spark with the local clone and token at `~/.hermes/profiles/corpusiq/secrets/github.token` - the documented fallback path
- Cross-reference method: extracted all 128 publisher slugs from the cached full leaderboard, grep-batched against `hermes/skills/`, zero-hit set then fetched in batches of 5
- Two publisher pages (squirrelscan, wonda) timed out on first fetch and succeeded on retry; Firecrawl 504s are transient
