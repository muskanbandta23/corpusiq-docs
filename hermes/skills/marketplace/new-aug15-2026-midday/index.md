# New Skills - August 15, 2026 (Midday Sweep)

Third skills.sh sweep of August 15. 40 API queries collected 3,944 unique skills; cross-referenced against the hermes/ tree, the hot leaderboard, and the morning queue. The dominant pattern this sweep was **queue underestimation**: candidates parked this morning at API-sum estimates turned out to be 6-15x larger on their publisher pages (argent 11.9K → 154.0K, oh-story 11.4K → 146.6K, vuejs-ai 10.7K → 129.2K, rivet 10.1K → 65.3K). Per the stale-assessment rule, every queued candidate was re-verified on its publisher page before drafting.

## Method Notes

- 40 API queries → 3,944 unique skills → top-120 clusters all present in the tree → hit triage separated real guides from queue mentions → 17 not-guided candidates identified (13 from the morning queue + 4 hot-leaderboard finds).
- Publisher pages fetched for all 15 drafted clusters; individual skill pages fetched for all single-skill clusters to get security-audit tiers (7 all-Pass → 🟢; Snyk Warn/Fail or Socket Warn named in Limitations → 🟡).
- Hot leaderboard surfaced trailofbits/skills-curated at #1 and rampstackco/claude-skills - both new to the tree.
- Single-skill audit tiers: interface-design 🟢 (3/3 Pass), feature-sliced-design 🟢 (3/3), design-motion-principles 🟢 (3/3), swift-testing-pro 🟢 (3/3), tailwind-4-docs 🟡 (Snyk Warn), watch 🟡 (Snyk Fail), superdesign 🟡 (Socket Warn + Snyk Fail).

## Notable Signals for CorpusIQ

- **Argent** (Software Mansion, creators of react-native-reanimated) gives us a vendor-grade mobile dev-agent toolkit - the largest queue underestimate of the day.
- **Oh Story's story-deslop** plus **trailofbits' humanizer** strengthen the de-AI-fication stack for public content.
- **RampStack's 103-skill suite** (seo-aeo-geo, email-deliverability, programmatic-seo, cro-optimization) is the biggest growth-marketing skill library catalogued to date - direct input for the docs SEO/AEO/GEO pass.
- **Tiangong's email SMTP/IMAP skills** are a self-hosted fallback path for our email operations.
- **Rivet's sandbox-agent and ai-agent-workspace** are reference patterns for agent sandboxing design.
