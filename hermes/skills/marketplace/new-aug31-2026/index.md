# New Skills - August 31, 2026

Forty-six-query skills.sh API sweep (4,743 unique skills, zero query failures) with cross-reference against the full hermes/ tree, plus hot-leaderboard candidate discovery with publisher-page verification. 117 clusters known, 3 API candidates, 2 of which resolved to existing coverage (`useosint/skills` source-string variant of the guided osint-skills cluster; `github/awesome-copilot` already guided). The hot leaderboard surfaced a further 9 candidates; publisher-page fetches promoted 8 to drafts and parked the rest.

## Method Notes

- 46-query API sweep returned 4,743 unique skills; the top-120 cluster diff flagged 3 candidates. `useosint/skills` (236.3K API sum) is the documented source-string variant of the already-guided `useosint/osint-skills` cluster - skipped. `github/awesome-copilot` (1.42M API sum) is already guided. `dart-lang/skills` was genuinely new (13.5K API sum undercounted the 144.0K publisher total 10x).
- The hot leaderboard was the primary discovery channel this sweep, per the Aug 17 calibration: `mohitmishra786/low-level-dev-skills` (6 skills at +1 1H), `basicmachines-co/basic-memory` (3 skills), `mengto/skills` (2 skills), `hubspot/agent-cli-skills`, `daymade/claude-code-skills`, and `lijigang/ljg-skills` all surfaced via hot-page deltas the API never ranked.
- Publisher-page totals are cited in guides (authoritative over API sums): dart-lang 144.0K vs 13.5K API sum, mengto 76.2K, daymade 58.4K, low-level-dev 41.5K, hubspot 17.8K, basic-memory 9.7K.
- Below-20K drafting justifications: hubspot/agent-cli-skills on first-party `hubspot` org authority plus direct CRM domain relevance (github/gh-stack precedent); basicmachines-co/basic-memory on YC-backed vendor authority plus agent-memory domain relevance (makerskills suite-cohesion precedent).
- Quality tiers follow audit badges: 🟢 where all three audits Pass (hallmark, dart-lang, mengto, basic-memory), 🟡 where Snyk (and Socket for hubspot) carry warnings, each named in the guide.
- `lijigang/ljg-skills` ships Chinese-language SKILL.md content; the source language is named in the guide's Limitations per the non-English-suite precedent (wecomteam, genshijin).

## Notable Signals for CorpusIQ

- Hallmark (nutlope, 27.6K⭐) encodes the anti-AI-slop design consensus CorpusIQ already enforces in content rules; it is the design-side counterpart to our content-voice gates.
- HubSpot's official agent skills are the vendor's own CRM operations playbook - direct material for CorpusIQ's HubSpot connector and data-quality use cases.
- Basic Machines' memory suite is the reference implementation of graph-first agent memory; its notes / observations / relations pattern maps onto how CorpusIQ agents structure session context.
