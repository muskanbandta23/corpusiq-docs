### Mobile Deployment (1 skill)

#### openclaw-android-setup (1,649⭐) ⭐ Setup Guide Available

**Repo:** [AidanPark/openclaw-android](https://github.com/AidanPark/openclaw-android)
**Author:** Aidan Park

Run OpenClaw agents on Android with a single command. Eliminates the 700MB-1GB overhead of proot-distro + Debian by installing just the glibc dynamic linker. Works on Android 7.0+ with Termux. Ideal for repurposing old phones as 24/7 agent nodes drawing only 3-5W.

**Key features:**
- No proot-distro - ~500MB total footprint (vs 1.5GB+)
- One-command install: `curl | bash`
- Works on phones as old as Samsung Galaxy S8+ (2017)
- Hermes-compatible skill installation via skills.sh
- Daemon mode for always-on agents
- Wake lock support to prevent Android sleep kills

**Setup Guide:** [OpenClaw on Android - Full Setup Guide](/hermes/skills/catalog/openclaw-android-setup/)

```bash
# In Termux (install from F-Droid, NOT Google Play):
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AidanPark/openclaw-android/main/setup.sh | bash

# Via skills.sh
npx skills add aradotso/hermes-skills --skill openclaw-android-setup
```

## Why These Matter for Hermes Users

### Browser Extension
The Hermes Browser Extension closes a critical UX gap: interacting with Hermes while browsing. Instead of copying text between terminal and browser, the side panel brings Hermes alongside your web activity. Research, debugging, content auditing - all with Hermes seeing exactly what you see.

### Android Deployment
Old Android phones are the cheapest self-hosted agent hardware available. A used Galaxy S8+ costs ~$50 and draws 3-5W - perfect for running a 24/7 monitoring agent, social media bot, or personal assistant. This project makes it trivial.
