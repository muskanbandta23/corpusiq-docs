## Notes

- **self-improving-agent** (32.2K installs) is the standout discovery - a universal agent self-evolution framework based on 2025 lifelong learning research. Uses multi-memory architecture (semantic + episodic + working) with hooks-based self-correction.
- **hermes-webui-agent** and **hermes-workspace-ai-agent-ui** extend the Hermes agent UI ecosystem with two different approaches: WebUI (lightweight Flask, daemon-managed) and Workspace (Next.js, swarm-enabled, full IDE-like experience).
- **hermes-traffic-guardian** is a specification-only skill (v0.0.1-beta5) from Prompt Security - builders implement the runtime. Currently a baseline for Hermes security posture integration.
- **codex-mcp-server-integration** bridges OpenAI Codex CLI into MCP-compatible editors, enabling AI code review and generation without leaving Hermes.
- These 7 skills were discovered using `npx skills find` with 16 targeted queries across Hermes, OpenClaw, MCP, security, and marketing domains.
- Total catalog now covers 347+ Hermes-relevant skills from skills.sh and community sources. Today's three sweeps (morning, afternoon, evening) added 23 total new setup guides.
