## Skipped Skills

- **openclaw-log-report** (junlincobo/openclaw-log-report, 88 installs) - 0 stars, no description, last updated April 2026. Low quality signal.
- **haiqing-self-improving-agent** (skills.volces.com, 41 installs) - Not accessible on GitHub; skills.volces.com is a custom registry. Unable to verify content or relevance.
- **crypto-price** (evgyur/crypto-price, 66 installs) - Clawdbot crypto lookup. 2 stars. Marginal Hermes relevance.
- **check-integration** (nowledge-co/community, 275 installs) - Could not locate SKILL.md in repo. The nowledge-co repo has Hermes (`nowledge-mem-hermes`) and OpenClaw (`nowledge-mem-openclaw-plugin`) directories - worth a dedicated sweep.

## Cross-Reference Notes

This update sweep ran after the [July 14 morning sweep](/hermes/skills/marketplace/new-july14-2026/) (2 skills). Extended queries across 15 broader ecosystem terms surfaced 4 additional skills, primarily from repos adjacent to the standard hermes/openclaw/clawdbot query set.

**Key repos discovered for future sweeps:**
- **ar9av/obsidian-wiki** - 37+ skills in `.skills/` directory. Only 3 previously catalogued (hermes-history-ingest, openclaw-history-ingest, wiki-history-ingest). The remaining 34+ skills (wiki-dashboard, wiki-lint, wiki-query, cross-linker, etc.) should be evaluated in a dedicated sweep.
- **davidondrej/skills** (2,510 ★) - 40 skills across 5 categories. Only 2 previously catalogued (distribute-skill-to-all-agents, browser-harness). 38 skills remain uncatalogued - many are agent infrastructure skills relevant to Hermes operations.
- **nowledge-co/community** (131 ★) - Has dedicated `nowledge-mem-hermes` and `nowledge-mem-openclaw-plugin` directories. Memory plugin for Hermes agents.
