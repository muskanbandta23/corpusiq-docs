# 🆕 June 30, 2026 - Update 2: 12 Additional Skills

**Date:** June 30, 2026 (Update to [June 30 sweep](/hermes/skills/marketplace/new-june30-2026/) and [Update 1](/hermes/skills/marketplace/new-june30-2026-update/))
**New Repos:** 2 | **New Skills:** 12 | **Combined Installs:** 3,478

Evening sweep across skills.sh surfaced 12 additional skills missed in the morning and midday passes. The headline find is **xurl** - Nous Research's official X/Twitter integration that was inexplicably absent from the catalog despite 171 installs. Google's **TimesFM** brings zero-shot forecasting to Hermes agents. The remaining 10 skills form the **ClawSec security suite** from prompt-security - the first comprehensive security toolkit for the OpenClaw/Clawbot agent ecosystem.
