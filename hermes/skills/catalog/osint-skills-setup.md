**First Seen:** August 13, 2026 sweep
**Quality Tier:** 🟢 Production (verification) / 🟡 Beta (advanced techniques)

The largest OSINT skill cluster on skills.sh - 57 skills covering the full investigation lifecycle. Flagships center on media verification (is this photo real, find the original image) and safe investigation practice (investigate without getting made, what leaked about you). The long tail adds domain recon, people search, breach analysis, geolocation, and intel-brief writing. Directly useful for brand protection, competitor research, and due diligence.

## Prerequisites

- No API keys for most skills; some advanced workflows benefit from Shodan/VPN access
- Operate within legal boundaries - these are investigative patterns, not intrusion tools

## CorpusIQ Use Cases

- **Competitor intelligence** - `x-ray-a-company` + `recon-a-domain-passively` feed the competitive-intelligence brief workflow
- **Brand protection** - `find-leaks-in-the-wild`, `find-exposed-servers`, and `secrets-in-git-history` as periodic risk scans for corpusiq.io
- **Lead verification** - `who-really-owns-it` and `whose-number-is-this` validate inbound leads before outreach spend
- **Content verification** - `is-this-photo-real` as a gate for UGC-sourced claims in daily reports

## Limitations / Verification

- Flagship verification skills are procedural (technique-based), not automated detectors - they guide an agent through manual checks
- Verify by running `is-this-photo-real` workflow on a known AI image and confirming the workflow flags it
