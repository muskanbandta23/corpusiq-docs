# Safari Web Agent - Setup Guide

**Source:** [treyxu23/safari-web-agent](https://github.com/treyxu23/safari-web-agent) · 1★
**Category:** Agent Infrastructure / Browser Automation
**Platform:** macOS only
**License:** MIT · **Published:** June 28, 2026

Safari Web Agent solves the browser automation anti-bot problem by using your **real Safari browser** - not a headless Chromium instance. Native macOS CGEvent (Core Graphics) sends actual clicks and keystrokes, so websites see a real user with your login sessions, cookies, and fingerprint. Works on sites where Playwright, Puppeteer, and Selenium get detected and blocked.

## Why Safari Instead of Playwright?

| Problem with Playwright | Safari Web Agent Solution |
|------------------------|--------------------------|
| Detected as bot | Real Safari - indistinguishable from human |
| No existing login sessions | Uses your logged-in Safari with all cookies |
| CAPTCHA triggers | Native CGEvent bypasses automated input detection |
| Cloudflare/WAF blocks | Real browser fingerprint passes all checks |
| macOS-specific workflows | Native AppleScript + CGEvent integration |

---

## CorpusIQ Use Cases

| Use Case | How |
|---|---|
| Competitor research | Browse competitor sites without bot detection |
| SaaS dashboard monitoring | Check real dashboards with your login sessions |
| Social media management | Post, check analytics, engage - as real user |

## Limitations

- **macOS only** - No Linux/Windows support
- **Single session** - One Safari window at a time
- **Visible browser** - Safari must be open (not headless)
- **Permission prompts** - First run requires user to grant Accessibility access
- **Speed** - Slower than headless browsers (real UI events have natural delays)
