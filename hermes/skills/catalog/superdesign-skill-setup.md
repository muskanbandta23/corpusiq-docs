Superdesign helps agents find design inspirations and styles, then generate and iterate design drafts on an infinite canvas. It runs through its own CLI and covers repo analysis (building .superdesign/init/ context), brand-new page design, design-system seeding, improvement requests, graphic assets (posters, covers, social creatives), and design from a live website via extract-website.

## Installation

```bash
npx skills add superdesigndev/superdesign-skill --skill superdesign
```

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Details |
|---|---|
| **Node.js + npx** | For the skill installer |
| **Shell access** | The skill runs entirely through its CLI |

## What It Provides

| Capability | Notes |
|---|---|
| Design inspiration | Find inspirations and styles |
| Infinite canvas drafts | Generate and iterate drafts on-canvas |
| Repo analysis | Build UI context to .superdesign/init/ |
| Live-site extraction | extract-website pulls design DNA, tokens, and brand assets |
| Graphic mode | Posters, covers, social posts, thumbnails, ad creatives with platform dimensions |
| State resume | .superdesign/resume.json for durable work across sessions |

## Quick Start

1. Install: `npx skills add superdesigndev/superdesign-skill --skill superdesign`
2. Run the environment preflight, then ask: "help me design the onboarding page for our product"

## CorpusIQ Use Cases

| Use Case | How |
|---|---|
| **Marketing assets** | Graphic mode for posters, covers, and social creatives |
| **Product UI drafts** | Design drafts for new pages and flows |
| **Design DNA extraction** | extract-website for competitor design reference |
| **Design system seeding** | Seed or refresh design systems from live sites |

## Limitations / Verification

- Socket Warn and Snyk Fail on the skill page - review flagged dependencies before production use
- Faithful pixel-recreation and editable on-canvas clones require the Superdesign app (superdesign.dev), not the CLI
- Install count verified on skill page: 8.0K

```bash
npx skills add superdesigndev/superdesign-skill   # verify install works
```
