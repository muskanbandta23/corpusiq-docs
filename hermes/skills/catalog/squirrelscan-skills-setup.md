Agent skills for the SquirrelScan website audit tool. The flagship `audit-website` (68.4K installs) walks an agent through a structured site audit - performance, SEO, accessibility, and content - using SquirrelScan's crawler output. Small cluster, high signal: website audits are one of the most common operator asks for agents.

## Installation

```bash
npx skills add squirrelscan/skills
```

## Core Skills

| Skill | Installs | Use For |
|---|---|---|
| audit-website | 68.4K | Structured website audit workflow |
| squirrelscan | 3.0K | Core SquirrelScan tool usage |

## Prerequisites

- A website to audit (any public URL works)
- Optional SquirrelScan account for full crawler reports

## CorpusIQ Use Cases

- **Docs site health** - periodic `audit-website` runs on docs.corpusiq.io complement the existing SEO/AEO/GEO pass
- **Competitor site teardowns** - quick structured audits of competitor landing pages for the competitive-intelligence brief
- **Client-facing value** - audit workflow reusable as a CorpusIQ onboarding artifact for business operators

## Limitations / Verification

- Community-maintained (86⭐); tool features may shift faster than the skill documents
- Verify by running the audit workflow against a small site and confirming the report sections populate
