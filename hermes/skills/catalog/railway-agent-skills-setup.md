# Railway Agent Skills

**Publisher:** [railwayapp/railway-skills](https://github.com/railwayapp/railway-skills) (300⭐)
**Skills.sh:** `npx skills add railwayapp/railway-skills`
**Installs:** 5,540+ (use-railway skill)
**Quality:** 🟢 Production - official Railway repository

> Agent skills for interacting with [Railway](https://railway.com) - deploy, manage, and monitor infrastructure through natural language. Includes Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, Grok Build, and Cursor plugins with local MCP configuration.

## What It Does

| Capability | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Infrastructure Deployment** | Deploy services, databases, and cron jobs to Railway |
| **Service Management** | Manage environment variables, domains, scaling, and service lifecycle |
| **Database Operations** | Provision PostgreSQL, Redis, MySQL, MongoDB with connection strings |
| **MCP Integration** | Local MCP server for direct Railway API access from agents |
| **Multi-Platform Plugins** | Claude Code, Codex CLI, Grok Build, Cursor - all supported |
| **CLI Wrapper** | Uses the Railway CLI (`railway`) for authenticated operations |

## Why This Matters for Hermes Agents

Railway skills give Hermes agents the ability to deploy infrastructure directly - provision databases, spin up services, set environment variables, and configure domains - without leaving the agent context. For teams using Railway as their deployment platform, this replaces manual dashboard operations with natural language commands like "deploy a PostgreSQL database and connect it to the API service."

## Installation

### Prerequisites

```bash
# Install Railway CLI
bash <(curl -fsSL https://railway.com/install.sh) -y

# Authenticate
railway login

# Verify
railway whoami
```

### Method 1: One-Command Agent Setup (recommended)

```bash
# Installs skills + configures MCP + checks auth - all in one
curl -fsSL agents.railway.com | sh
```

Or with CLI install:
```bash
bash <(curl -fsSL https://railway.com/install.sh) --agents -y
```

### Method 2: skills.sh CLI

```bash
npx skills add railwayapp/railway-skills --full-depth -y
```

### Method 3: Claude Code Plugin

```bash
# Via Anthropic's official marketplace (recommended)
/plugin install railway@claude-plugins-official

# Or via Railway's own marketplace
/plugin marketplace add railwayapp/railway-skills
/plugin install railway@railway-skills
/reload-plugins
```

### Method 4: OpenAI Codex

1. Open Codex → **Plugins** in the sidebar
2. Open **More** dropdown → **Add more**
3. Enter `railwayapp/railway-skills` as the marketplace source

### Method 5: Cursor

```bash
# Via Cursor Marketplace
/add-plugin railway
```

Or from Settings → Plugins → paste `https://github.com/railwayapp/railway-skills`

## Quick Reference

| Task | Trigger Phrase |
|------|---------------|
| Deploy a service | "Deploy this Node.js app to Railway" |
| Add a database | "Provision a PostgreSQL database on Railway" |
| Set env vars | "Set the DATABASE_URL environment variable on Railway" |
| Scale a service | "Scale the API service to 2 replicas" |
| Add a domain | "Add a custom domain to my Railway service" |
| Check logs | "Show me the logs for the worker service" |
| List projects | "List all my Railway projects" |

## Usage Examples

### Deployment
```
"Deploy this Express app to Railway with a PostgreSQL database"
"Provision a Redis instance and connect it to the API service"
"Set up a cron job that runs the cleanup script every hour"
"Add the production environment variables from .env.production to Railway"
```

### Service Management
```
"Scale the worker service to handle increased traffic"
"Roll back the API service to the previous deployment"
"Add a health check endpoint to the web service"
"Configure autoscaling for the API - min 2, max 5 replicas"
```

### Infrastructure
```
"Show all my Railway projects and their services"
"What's the connection string for the production database?"
"Set up a staging environment that mirrors production config"
"Monitor the memory usage of the worker service"
```

## Verification

```bash
# Verify Railway CLI is authenticated
railway whoami

# List projects to confirm connectivity
railway projects list

# Verify skills are installed
hermes skills list | grep railway

# Quick smoke test - ask the agent:
"List my Railway projects"
```

## Pro Tips

1. **Use the one-command setup (`curl -fsSL agents.railway.com | sh`).** It handles skills installation, MCP configuration, and auth verification in a single step - no manual wiring needed.

2. **The MCP server provides direct Railway API access.** Skills.sh-only installs require the Railway CLI to be pre-authenticated. The plugin installs (Claude Code, Cursor) include the MCP server for keyless OAuth access.

3. **Environment variable management is the most-used feature.** Railway's env var system with shared variables and service-specific overrides is its killer feature. The agent skills make bulk env var updates, secret rotation, and environment parity checks straightforward.

4. **Database provisioning includes connection string generation.** When the agent provisions a database, it automatically surfaces the connection string - no need to dig through the Railway dashboard to find credentials.

5. **The `claude-plugins-official` marketplace pins to specific commits.** For the latest features, add Railway's own marketplace (`railwayapp/railway-skills`) which tracks the main branch directly.
