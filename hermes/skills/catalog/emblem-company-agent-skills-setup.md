```

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Details |
|---|---|
| **Node.js + npx** | For the skill installer |
| **Emblem platform access** | For wallet, portfolio, and trading skills |
| **Funded wallet** | For any live token operations - and strong guardrails |

|---|---|---|
| emblem-portfolio-tracker | 8.9K | Track portfolio positions and performance |
| emblem-market-research | 8.8K | Market research workflows |
| emblem-ai-agent-wallet | 8.8K | Agent-managed wallet operations |

## Quick Start

1. Install: `npx skills add emblemcompany/agent-skills`
2. Start read-only: `emblem-portfolio-tracker` and `emblem-market-research` need no transaction authority
3. Gate any wallet or swap skill behind human approval before first live use

## CorpusIQ Use Cases

| Use Case | How |
|---|---|
| **Market research pattern** | emblem-market-research as a reference workflow for our own research sweeps |
| **Portfolio reporting** | Tracker-style aggregation for investment reporting |
| **Fintech client work** | Reference architecture for clients building agent-managed finance products |
| **Guardrail study** | A real-world case of agent wallet skills - useful when advising on AI finance safety |

## Limitations / Verification

- Publisher-page install counts verified; individual skill audit pages were not fetched for this multi-skill suite
- Wallet and token-swap skills can move real value - never run them without explicit transaction limits and human approval
- Emblem platform account and possibly a funded wallet required for full functionality

```bash
npx skills add emblemcompany/agent-skills   # verify install works
```
