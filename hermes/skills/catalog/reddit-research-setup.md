# Reddit Research & Leads - Setup Guide

**Source:** [lignertys/reddit-research-skill](https://skills.sh/lignertys/reddit-research-skill) (4.1K+ combined installs)
**Category:** Research / Lead Generation
**Quality Tier:** 🟡 Beta

Two skills in one repo providing Reddit data access without Reddit's API rate limits. **reddapi** offers semantic search across millions of posts and comments, subreddit discovery, and trend analysis. **reddit-leads** uses AI-powered lead scoring (0-100) to find B2B prospects actively expressing buying intent across 50K+ subreddits.

Key advantage: This is a third-party service, not Reddit official - so there are **no rate limits, no daily quotas, and 24/7 availability**. 1024D vector search matches on meaning, not just keywords.

## Key Capabilities

### Semantic Search (reddapi)
Natural language search across millions of Reddit posts - no keyword matching, meaning-based:

```bash
# Market research
curl -X POST "https://reddapi.dev/api/v1/search/semantic" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $REDDAPI_API_KEY" \
  -d '{"query": "best productivity tools for remote teams", "limit": 100}'

# Pain point discovery - "I wish there was an app that"
curl -X POST "https://reddapi.dev/api/v1/search/semantic" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $REDDAPI_API_KEY" \
  -d '{"query": "I wish there was an app that", "limit": 100}'

# Competitor complaints
curl -X POST "https://reddapi.dev/api/v1/search/semantic" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $REDDAPI_API_KEY" \
  -d '{"query": "COMPETITOR_NAME problems complaints", "limit": 200}'
```

### Trend Analysis (reddapi)
Discover trending topics with engagement metrics and sentiment:

```bash
curl "https://reddapi.dev/api/v1/trends" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $REDDAPI_API_KEY"
```

Response includes: `post_count`, `total_upvotes`, `avg_sentiment` (-1 to 1), `trending_keywords`, `growth_rate`.

### B2B Lead Discovery (reddit-leads)
AI scores every post 0-100 on buying intent with 5 lead type categories:

| Lead Type | Signal |
|---|---|
| **pain_point** | User describing a problem, looking for solution |
| **solution_request** | Actively asking "what tool should I use for X" |
| **complaint** | Frustrated with current tool - switching signal |
| **feature_request** | Wants something their tool doesn't have |
| **comparison** | Evaluating options - ready to buy |

### Subreddit Discovery (reddapi)

```bash
# List popular subreddits
curl "https://reddapi.dev/api/subreddits?limit=100" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $REDDAPI_API_KEY"

# Get specific subreddit info
curl "https://reddapi.dev/api/subreddits/programming" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $REDDAPI_API_KEY"
```
