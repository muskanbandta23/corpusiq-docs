# Extract Design System - Setup Guide

**Repo:** [github.com/arvindrk/extract-design-system](https://github.com/arvindrk/extract-design-system)
**Category:** Design Quality / UI Engineering
**First Seen:** August 13, 2026
**Quality Tier:** 🟢 Production (127.3K installs - the largest single-skill install count in the August 13 sweep)

A single skill with a 127K install base: `extract-design-system` reverse-engineers an existing interface into a structured design system - color tokens, typography scales, spacing rules, and component patterns. It solves the hardest problem in agent-driven UI work: matching an existing brand instead of generating a generic look. Pair it with `anti-ui-slop` for a complete design-quality pipeline.
