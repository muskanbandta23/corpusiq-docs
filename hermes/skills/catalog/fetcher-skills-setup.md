# Fetcher Skills - Setup Guide

**Source:** [fetcher-sh/fetcher-skills](https://www.skills.sh/fetcher-sh/fetcher-skills) (7 skills · 971 combined installs)
**Repo:** [github.com/fetcher-sh/fetcher-skills](https://github.com/fetcher-sh/fetcher-skills)
**Category:** Social API / Platform Integration
**First Seen:** August 13, 2026
**Quality Tier:** 🟡 Beta (`twitter-api` at 938 installs, trending on the hot leaderboard)

Fetcher.sh publishes API-access skills for the major social platforms. `twitter-api` carries almost the entire install base at 938 and was on the hot leaderboard during the August 13 sweep. The cluster covers API access patterns for X/Twitter, Instagram, and TikTok, with scraper variants as fallbacks. Useful as the procedural layer around API credentials an agent already holds.

## Prerequisites

## CorpusIQ Use Cases

| Use Case | How |
|---|---|
| **Social monitoring** | API-first checks of mentions and replies |
| **Posting pipelines** | `twitter-api` as reference for X automation |
| **Competitive listening** | Structured reads of competitor activity |

---

## Limitations / Verification

- Small cluster - only `twitter-api` has meaningful install volume
- Scraper skills may conflict with platform anti-bot systems; prefer official APIs
- Verify install: `npx skills list | grep -E 'twitter|tiktok|instagram'`
