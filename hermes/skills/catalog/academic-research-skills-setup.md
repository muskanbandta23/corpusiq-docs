A four-skill academic research suite: academic-paper for paper drafting, academic-paper-reviewer for peer-review workflows, deep-research for multi-source investigation, and academic-pipeline for end-to-end research orchestration. Distinct from the separate `izillionways/academic-research-skills-hermes` repo already in our ecosystem tracking - this is the skills.sh marketplace cluster.
