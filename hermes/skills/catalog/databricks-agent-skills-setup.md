## Key Capabilities

### Databricks Apps
Build data applications that run natively on Databricks with built-in authentication, compute, and data access. Apps can be dashboards, APIs, or full web applications backed by Databricks SQL warehouses or serverless compute.

### Delta Live Tables
Declarative ETL pipeline framework with automatic data quality enforcement, schema evolution, and incremental processing. Define expectations for data quality and get automatic monitoring and alerting when quality rules are violated.

### Unity Catalog Lakehouse
Centralized governance for data and AI assets. Manage tables, views, volumes, models, and functions with fine-grained access control. Enable data discovery with tags and lineage tracking.

### Model Serving
Deploy ML models as REST endpoints for real-time inference. Support for MLflow models, foundation models from Databricks Marketplace, and custom LLM deployments. Auto-scaling and GPU acceleration for production inference.

### Vector Search
Create and query vector indexes for semantic search and RAG. Integrate with Databricks embedding models. Power retrieval-augmented generation pipelines with managed vector infrastructure.
