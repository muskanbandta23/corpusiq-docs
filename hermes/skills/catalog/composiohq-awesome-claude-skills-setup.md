## Notes

- 28 skills total - install only what you need. Each skill is self-contained.
- GitHub repo is a curated list, not a monorepo - skills reference external tools and APIs
- The **lead-research-assistant** and **competitive-ads-extractor** are particularly valuable for growth operations
- **webapp-testing** overlaps with Anthropic's official webapp-testing skill (121.9K installs) - prefer the official one unless you need Composio-specific integration features
- Most skills require API keys for external services (LangSmith, Slack, Twitter) - configure before first use
