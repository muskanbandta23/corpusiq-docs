# wshobson/agents - Agent Plugin Marketplace

**Source:** [wshobson/agents](https://github.com/wshobson/agents) (9.1K+ installs for top skill)
**Category:** Agent Orchestration / Plugins
**Harnesses:** Claude Code, Codex CLI, Cursor, OpenCode, Gemini CLI, GitHub Copilot

Massive agent plugin marketplace with 94 plugins, 203 agents, 175 skills, and 109 commands. One source-of-truth (`plugins/`) compiled into idiomatic artifacts for six different agent harnesses. Each harness gets native artifacts - not lowest-common-denominator translations.

### For Hermes (Claude Code-based)

```bash
# Add the marketplace
/plugin marketplace add wshobson/agents

# Install individual plugins
/plugin install python-development
/plugin install security-audit
/plugin install memory-forensics
```

### For Other Harnesses

```bash
# Codex CLI
npx codex-marketplace add wshobson/agents

# Cursor
# Add marketplace, then /plugin install <name>

# Gemini CLI
gh repo clone wshobson/agents ~/agents && cd ~/agents
make generate HARNESS=gemini && gemini extensions install .

# OpenCode
gh repo clone wshobson/agents ~/agents && cd ~/agents
make install-opencode

## Architecture

```
plugins/
├── python-development/     # 90+ local plugins
├── security-audit/
├── memory-forensics/
├── ... (94 total)
├── agents/                  # 203 domain-expert agents
├── skills/                  # 175 modular knowledge packages
└── commands/                # 109 slash commands
```

Each plugin is isolated and composable. Agents, commands, and skills are auto-discovered. Progressive disclosure ensures skills only load when activated.

### Harness Compilation

```
Source (plugins/) ──▶ Harness Generator ──▶ Native artifacts
                         │
                         ├── Claude Code (.claude-plugin/)
                         ├── Codex CLI (codex-marketplace format)
                         ├── Cursor (.cursor-plugin/)
                         ├── OpenCode (generated + symlinked)
                         ├── Gemini CLI (generated + transformed)
                         └── GitHub Copilot (copilot plugin format)
```

## Common Workflows

### Security Audit Workflow

```bash
# 1. Install security plugins
/plugin install security-audit
/plugin install vulnerability-scan
/plugin install memory-forensics

# 2. Run security audit
/security:audit --target ./src --output audit-report.md

# 3. Run memory forensics on agent context
/memory:forensics --session-id current --output memory-report.json
```

### Multi-Agent Development

```bash
# 1. Install orchestrator + dev plugins
/plugin install multi-agent-orchestrator
/plugin install python-development
/plugin install typescript-development

# 2. Start coordinated workflow
/orchestrator:full-stack --spec ./spec.md --output ./output/
```

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `/plugin marketplace add` fails | Network/auth issue | Verify `gh` CLI is authenticated: `gh auth status` |
| Plugin not found | Marketplace not registered | Re-run `marketplace add` command |
| Skills don't activate | Plugin not installed | Check with `/plugin list` |
| Harness-specific failures | Generated artifacts stale | Re-clone and regenerate for your harness |
| Gemini CLI setup fails | Missing `make` | `sudo apt-get install make` |

---

## Comparison: Other Agent Marketplaces

| Marketplace | Plugins | Harnesses | Hermes Support |
|---|---|---|---|
| **wshobson/agents** | 94 | 6 | Via Claude Code harness |
| anthropics/knowledge-work-plugins | 11 | 2 (Cowork + Code) | Via Claude Code only |
| github/awesome-copilot | 14 skills | 1 (Copilot) | MCP generators work anywhere |
| vercel-labs/agent-skills | 6 | 1 (Vercel) | Framework-specific |

**Recommendation:** wshobson/agents has the broadest coverage. Use as the primary agent plugin source. Supplement with github/awesome-copilot for GitHub/MCP automation and anthropics/knowledge-work-plugins for enterprise workflows.
