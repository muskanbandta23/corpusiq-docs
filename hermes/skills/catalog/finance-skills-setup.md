# Financial statements
balance_sheet = ticker.balance_sheet
income_stmt = ticker.income_stmt

# Options chain
options = ticker.option_chain('2026-08-21')

# Multiple tickers
data = yf.download(["AAPL", "MSFT", "GOOGL"], period="6mo")
```
Covers 19 data categories: stock prices, history, financials, options, dividends, earnings, analyst targets, institutional holders, insider transactions, and more.

## Notes

- **Not financial advice**: All data is for research and educational purposes. Never auto-trade or place orders.
- **Rate limiting**: Yahoo Finance may rate-limit frequent requests. Use `yf.download()` for bulk queries instead of individual `Ticker` calls.
- **Data accuracy**: yfinance is not affiliated with Yahoo, Inc. Data may have delays or discrepancies vs. official sources.
- **Hermes integration**: Combine with `timesfm-forecasting` for time-series predictions, or with the `corpusiq-research-intelligence-framework` for competitive market analysis.
- **Business operator use case**: CorpusIQ agents can use these skills to provide market context, competitor stock performance, and industry trend analysis to business operators.
