## Overview

The ClawDBot Feishu Suite provides complete integration with Feishu (Lark) - ByteDance's enterprise collaboration platform used by 100M+ users across China and Southeast Asia. These 11 skills cover every Feishu API surface: documents, drive, wiki, messaging, task management, permissions, E2E testing, and release workflows.

## International vs. China Deployment

Feishu operates two separate clouds:

| | **Feishu (China)** | **Lark (International)** |
|---|---|---|
| Domain | feishu.cn | larksuite.com |
| API Base | open.feishu.cn | open.larksuite.com |
| Users | China, SEA | Global |
| Compliance | China data laws | GDPR, international |

Set `FEISHU_BASE_URL` to match your deployment region.

## CorpusIQ Use Cases

1. **China Market Operations:** For CorpusIQ operators targeting Chinese enterprises, Feishu integration is essential. Use `feishu-doc` + `feishu-message` for client communication and deliverable sharing.

2. **Internal Documentation:** Use `feishu-wiki` to maintain a searchable knowledge base of agent workflows, integration guides, and troubleshooting runbooks.

3. **Task Automation:** Use `feishu-task` for automated task creation from customer requests - new inquiry → task in Feishu → agent processes → status update.

4. **Multi-Platform Sync:** Combine with Google Workspace skills for cross-platform content sync - write in Feishu, mirror to Google Docs.

5. **Release Management:** Use `release` + `feishu-message` for automated release announcements to team channels.

## Troubleshooting

### "App not authorized" errors
Run through OAuth flow in Feishu Developer Console → Security Settings → configure redirect URL. Ensure all required permissions are approved.

### Messages not sending
Verify the bot has been added to the target chat/channel. Bots cannot send to chats they haven't been invited to.

### Rate limiting (429 errors)
Feishu API has tiered rate limits:
- 100 req/s for message sending
- 50 req/s for document operations
- 20 req/s for admin operations

Implement exponential backoff for high-volume workflows.

### Token expiration
Feishu uses tenant access tokens with 2-hour expiry. The skill automatically refreshes, but if tokens expire mid-operation, re-running the command will trigger a fresh token fetch.
