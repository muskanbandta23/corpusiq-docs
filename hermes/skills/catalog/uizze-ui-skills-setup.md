# Uizze UI Skills - Setup Guide

**Source:** [uizze.com](https://www.skills.sh/site/uizze.com) (5 skills · 394.7K combined installs)
**Site:** [uizze.com](https://uizze.com/)
**Category:** Design Quality / UI Engineering
**First Seen:** August 12, 2026
**Quality Tier:** 🟢 Production (`anti-ui-slop` at 260.5K installs)

Uizze's skills attack a specific problem: "UI slop" - the generic, samey, gradient-and-glassmorphism interfaces that AI coding agents default to. `anti-ui-slop` is the flagship at 260.5K installs, joined by `ui-radar` (132K) which scans and scores existing interfaces. Together they form a design-quality gate for anything an agent builds.

## Installation

```bash
# Site registry listing - install by skill
npx skills add https://skills.sh/site/uizze.com --skill anti-ui-slop
npx skills add https://skills.sh/site/uizze.com --skill ui-radar
```

If the CLI rejects site-registry sources, clone the skill definitions directly from [uizze.com](https://uizze.com/) and drop them into the agent's skills directory.

## Prerequisites

## CorpusIQ Use Cases

| Use Case | How |
|---|---|
| **Docs site polish** | `ui-radar` audit on docs.corpusiq.io before design passes |
| **Agent-built dashboards** | `anti-ui-slop` as a pre-ship gate on agent-generated UI |
| **Competitive UI reviews** | `ui-radar` to benchmark competitor interfaces |
| **Design QA for HyperFrames/landing pages** | Score and fix before publish |

---

## Limitations / Verification

- Site-registry publisher (no GitHub repo) - install path depends on skills.sh CLI support for site sources
- `anti-ai-ui-slop` at 3 installs is experimental
- Verify install: `npx skills list | grep -i slop`
