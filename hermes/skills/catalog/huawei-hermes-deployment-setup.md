## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Fix |
|---|---|
| "Docker daemon not running" | `sudo systemctl start docker && sudo systemctl enable docker` |
| "ARM64 image not found" | Rebuild: `docker compose build --no-cache` |
| "OBS access denied" | Verify IAM permissions for OBS bucket access in Huawei Cloud console |
| "Port 443 already in use" | Change Nginx port in `docker-compose.override.yml` |

## Verification

```bash
# Verify skill installed
hermes skills list | grep huawei-cloud-flexus

# Check deployment template
ls SKILL_DIR/templates/docker-compose.yml
