# Lark & Feishu Skills - Setup Guide

**Source:** [open.feishu.cn](https://www.skills.sh/site/open.feishu.cn) (28 skills · 14.8M combined installs) and [larksuite/cli](https://www.skills.sh/larksuite/cli) (32 skills · 10.2M combined installs)
**GitHub:** [github.com/larksuite/cli](https://github.com/larksuite/cli)
**Category:** Platform Integrations / Office Suite
**First Seen:** August 12, 2026
**Quality Tier:** 🟢 Production (official Feishu/Lark platform publishers)

Lark - Feishu's international brand - publishes two official listings on skills.sh covering the entire Lark office suite. Every surface is agent-native: Docs, Base (the database builder), Sheets, Drive, IM (messaging), Wiki, Calendar, Mail, Tasks, video Meetings, Approvals, Slides, Attendance, OKR, and Markdown rendering, plus open-platform API tooling. Together these two listings are the largest office-suite skill cluster on skills.sh (~25M listed installs).

## Installation

```bash
# Install the full official CLI repo (GitHub-backed, 32 skills)
npx skills add larksuite/cli

# Or install individual skills
npx skills add larksuite/cli --skill lark-doc
npx skills add larksuite/cli --skill lark-base
npx skills add larksuite/cli --skill lark-im
npx skills add larksuite/cli --skill lark-wiki
npx skills add larksuite/cli --skill lark-sheets
```

The `open.feishu.cn` listing mirrors the same skill set as a site registry (no GitHub repo required) - use it as a fallback when the CLI repo install is blocked.

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Details |
|---|---|
| Lark / Feishu account | Free tier works for most skills |
| Developer app credentials | `app_id` + `app_secret` from the [Feishu open platform](https://open.feishu.cn/) for API-backed skills |
| Bot permissions | Scope grants for the surfaces you use (docs, base, im, etc.) |
| Node.js + npx | For the skills.sh CLI install path |

API-backed skills read credentials from the environment (`LARK_APP_ID` / `LARK_APP_SECRET` or an equivalent config file); check each skill's SKILL.md for the exact variable names.

## CorpusIQ Use Cases

| Use Case | How |
|---|---|
| **Operator SOP automation** | `lark-base` + `lark-doc` to read/write runbooks and tracking tables |
| **Meeting ops** | `lark-workflow-meeting-summary` and `lark-workflow-standup-report` automate recurring team rituals |
| **IM-triggered agents** | `lark-im` as an inbound channel for agent workflows alongside Telegram/Discord |
| **OKR cadence** | `lark-okr` for quarterly tracking from an agent |
| **Feishu-first orgs** | Complements the existing Clawdbot Feishu setup for mixed-agent deployments |

---

## Limitations / Verification

- Two listings publish near-identical skill sets - the GitHub-backed `larksuite/cli` is the primary install path; the site listing is a mirror
- Verify install: `npx skills list | grep lark-` should show the installed skills
- API-backed skills require a developer app; IM/bot skills need scopes approved before first call
