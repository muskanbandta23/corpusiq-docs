# Sentry Agent Skills - Setup Guide

**Source:** [getsentry/skills](https://skills.sh/getsentry/skills)
**GitHub:** [getsentry/skills](https://github.com/getsentry/skills)
**Skills:** 31 skills · 85.3K total installs
**Category:** Code Review & Security
**First Seen:** catalogued August 15, 2026 evening sweep
**Quality Tier:** 🟢 Production (official org - Sentry, the application monitoring vendor)

Sentry's official agent skill suite encodes the review and release hygiene its own engineers use: security review against OWASP-class issues, code simplification, bug finding, PR writing and iteration, GitHub Actions security review, and internal ops skills (agents-md, claude-settings-audit, sred work summaries). Queued in prior sweeps at a 20.7K API-sum estimate; the publisher page shows 85.3K - a 4x jump, which is why it leads this batch.

## Quick Start

1. Install: `npx skills add getsentry/skills`
2. Start with `security-review` or `code-review` before merging any PR
3. Ask: "run a security review on my changes and draft the PR description"

## CorpusIQ Use Cases

| Use Case | How |
|---|---|
| **PR security gate** | security-review + gha-security-review as an agent-side review layer for our GitHub work |
| **Repo hygiene** | code-simplifier and find-bugs for maintenance passes on internal tooling |
| **PR automation** | pr-writer, iterate-pr, and gh-review-requests replace manual PR boilerplate |
| **Sentry integration pairing** | Natural fit when instrumenting projects with Sentry error monitoring |
| **Reference skills** | skill-writer and skill-creator as templates for our own skill packaging |

## Limitations / Verification

- Publisher-page install counts verified; individual skill audit pages were not fetched for this multi-skill suite
- Django-specific skills require a Django project to be useful
- `warden-lint-judge` (37 installs) is effectively brand-new - treat as untested

```bash
npx skills add getsentry/skills   # verify install works
```
