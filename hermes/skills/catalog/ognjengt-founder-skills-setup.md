## Key Capabilities

### Viral Hook Creator
- **18 Hook Patterns**: Pattern selection matrix maps each pattern to goal + platform
- **4 Trigger Word Categories**:
  - **Insider** (secretly, revealed, hidden, uncovered) → exclusivity
  - **Helper** (losing, wasting, bleeding, stealing) → problem/urgency
  - **Thinker** (backwards, myth, counterintuitive, paradox) → contrarian
  - **Amplifiers** (literally, every, zero, completely) → intensity
- **Platform-Specific**: X (short/punchy), LinkedIn (professional/insightful), Instagram (visual/emotional), TikTok (hook-first 3 seconds)
- **Differentiation**: Each generated hook uses a unique pattern

### SOP Creator
- Workflow documentation from process descriptions
- Step-by-step format with roles and responsibilities
