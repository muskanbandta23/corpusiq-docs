Stop Slop eliminates predictable AI writing patterns from prose: filler phrases, formulaic structures, passive voice, vague declaratives, and narrator-from-a-distance framing. Its seven core rules read like a compressed style guide for human-sounding output - and it even bans em dashes, matching our own public-content rule.

## Installation

```bash
npx skills add hardikpandya/stop-slop
```

Individual skills install with the explicit repo form:

```bash
npx skills add https://github.com/hardikpandya/stop-slop --skill stop-slop
```

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Details |
|---|---|
| **Node.js + npx** | For the skill installer |
| **Prose to clean** | Any draft - post, email, doc, or page copy |

## What It Provides

The skill's seven core rules:

1. Cut filler phrases, emphasis crutches, and adverbs
2. Break formulaic structures (binary contrasts, negative listings, rhetorical setups)
3. Active voice - every sentence has a human subject doing something
4. Be specific - no vague declaratives or lazy extremes
5. Put the reader in the room - "you" beats "people"
6. Vary rhythm - mix sentence lengths; no em dashes
7. Trust readers - state facts directly, skip hand-holding

Reference files (`references/phrases.md`, `references/structures.md`) carry the concrete pattern lists.

## Quick Start

1. Install: `npx skills add hardikpandya/stop-slop`
2. Ask: "run stop-slop on this draft"
3. Apply the seven rules; the pattern references guide the rewrite

## CorpusIQ Use Cases

| Use Case | How |
|---|---|
| **Public content gate** | Pairs with our content-voice rules and slop scoring - a second pass before anything ships publicly |
| **Email quality** | Executive-facing and outreach emails read human at first pass |
| **UGC script cleanup** | Video scripts and captions lose the AI rhythm before recording |

## Limitations / Verification

- Security audits on stop-slop: Gen Agent Trust Hub Pass, Socket Pass, Snyk Pass - clean across all three
- Publisher-page install counts verified (10.6K single skill); GitHub 15.7K stars on the repo
- Single-skill cluster - the whole value is the seven rules plus the two reference files
- Complementary, not competitive, with avoid-ai-writing: stop-slop is the compressed ruleset; avoid-ai-writing is the audited multi-mode workflow

```bash
npx skills add hardikpandya/stop-slop   # verify install works
```
