# Skills Catalog

Welcome to the Hermes Skills Catalog  --  your directory of community-contributed, validated skills that extend what Hermes can do. Skills encode repeatable expertise into shareable packages that anyone in the Hermes community can install and use.

## Skill Quality Tiers

Not all skills are created equal. We use three quality tiers to help you understand what you're installing:

### Production Tier 🟢

Production-tier skills meet all of these criteria:

- Tested by at least three independent community members
- Includes comprehensive error handling for all known failure modes
- Documentation covers setup, invocation, expected output, and troubleshooting
- Confirmation gates on all write/destructive operations
- Maintained actively (updated within 30 days of reported issues)
- Pinned dependencies and explicit version requirements
- Audit trail for all data access

These skills are safe for production use. You can rely on them as components of your automated workflows. Look for the 🟢 indicator in the catalog.

### Beta Tier 🟡

Beta-tier skills are functional and well-tested by their authors but haven't completed community validation:

- Tested by the author and at least one other person
- Handles common error cases but may have gaps in edge-case handling
- Documentation covers basic usage but may lack troubleshooting depth
- May lack comprehensive confirmation gates
- Updated within 90 days

These skills are suitable for supervised use. They'll save you time but keep an eye on them  --  especially in the first few runs. Look for the 🟡 indicator.

### Community Tier 🔵

Community-tier skills are shared in good faith but haven't completed formal validation:

- Published by a community member
- May have been tested only on the author's setup
- Documentation may be minimal
- Error handling may be incomplete
- Best suited for learning, inspiration, and adaptation  --  not production reliance

These skills are valuable for the community but require due diligence before relying on them. Look for the 🔵 indicator.

## How to Evaluate a Skill Before Installing

Before you trust a skill with your data and credentials, do this five-minute review:

### 1. Read the Skill Description
Does it clearly state what it does, what connectors it needs, and what output it produces? A skill that can't explain itself in three sentences is a red flag.

### 2. Check the Required Permissions
What connectors and tools does the skill call? Does "Generate weekly report" really need write access to your CRM? If the permission scope exceeds the stated purpose, investigate before installing.

### 3. Review the Error Handling
Open the skill file and look for error handling blocks. Does it handle timeouts? Rate limits? Missing data? A skill with no error handling will fail silently or confusingly.

### 4. Look for Confirmation Gates
If the skill can modify data, does it require confirmation before doing so? Any skill that writes without explicit user approval is a production risk.

### 5. Check Recency and Maintenance
When was the skill last updated? A skill that hasn't been touched in 12 months may have broken dependencies or incompatible API versions. Check the changelog.

### 6. Read Community Feedback
Look for comments, issues, or reviews from other community members. "Works great on my setup" from one person is positive. "Breaks when the dataset exceeds 100 records" is actionable.

### 7. Test in a Safe Environment
Run the skill first in a read-only mode or with limited data. Before you let it loose on your production CRM, test it on your sandbox.

## Curated Starter Pack

New to Hermes? These 10 skills are the most commonly recommended starting points. They cover essential workflows and are all Production-tier verified.

### 1. Daily Briefing
**What it does:** Your morning dashboard  --  calendar, priority emails, task list, and key metrics from connected services. One invocation replaces five separate checks.  
**Needs:** Calendar, email, and optionally CRM or project management connectors.  
**Why start here:** Replaces your morning routine with a single command. Immediate time savings.

### 2. Email Digest
**What it does:** Summarizes unread emails from a configurable time window, groups by thread, flags urgent items, and drafts suggested replies for routine messages.  
**Needs:** Email connector (Gmail or Outlook).  
**Why start here:** The average knowledge worker spends 2+ hours on email daily. This cuts it substantially.

### 3. Meeting Prep
**What it does:** Before a meeting, gathers relevant emails, documents, previous meeting notes, and action items related to the attendees and topic. Produces a one-page briefing.  
**Needs:** Calendar, email, and optionally drive or project management connectors.  
**Why start here:** Never walk into a meeting underprepared again.

### 4. Weekly Report Generator
**What it does:** Aggregates activity from your connected services into a structured weekly summary  --  tasks completed, meetings attended, key communications, metrics trends.  
**Needs:** Project management, calendar, email (configurable).  
**Why start here:** Automates the Friday afternoon ritual. Customize the template to match your team's format.

### 5. CRM Health Check
**What it does:** Pipeline analysis, stale deals, overdue follow-ups, and contact engagement scoring. Flags accounts that need attention.  
**Needs:** CRM connector (HubSpot, Salesforce, or similar).  
**Why start here:** Your CRM has data but Hermes turns it into action items.

### 6. Data to Chart
**What it does:** Takes a dataset (from any connector or upload) and generates appropriate visualizations  --  time series, distribution, comparison, correlation.  
**Needs:** Any data source (accepts structured data from other skills).  
**Why start here:** Visual insight without spreadsheet wrestling.

### 7. Content Drafting Assistant
**What it does:** Drafts blog posts, social media updates, newsletters, and other content following your brand voice. Includes tone calibration and audience targeting.  
**Needs:** No specific connectors (optionally integrates with CMS or social platforms).  
**Why start here:** Beat the blank page. All output is draft  --  you remain the editor.

### 8. Code Review Companion
**What it does:** Reviews code changes for bugs, security issues, style consistency, and documentation completeness. Provides actionable, specific feedback.  
**Needs:** File access or repository connector.  
**Why start here:** A second pair of eyes on every PR, catching issues before humans spend time reviewing.

### 9. Travel Planner
**What it does:** Given destination and dates, gathers flight options, hotel availability, weather forecasts, and local information. Organizes into a comparison view.  
**Needs:** Calendar (for availability context).  
**Why start here:** Research acceleration  --  you still book, but Hermes does the hunting.

### 10. Knowledge Base Q&A
**What it does:** Searches your organization's documentation, wikis, and shared drives to answer questions. "What's our vacation policy?" "How do I set up the VPN?"  
**Needs:** Drive, wiki, or documentation connectors.  
**Why start here:** Reduces the "just ask Bob" tax on your organization's experts.

## Installing a Skill

Skills from the catalog install with a single command. From the catalog page, copy the install command and run it in your Hermes terminal. The skill and its dependencies are installed to your profile.

```bash
hermes skills install skill-id
```

After installation, configure any required connectors. Most skills include a setup guide that walks through connector authentication. Test with a dry run before relying on the skill in production workflows.

## Contributing to the Catalog

The skills catalog thrives on community contributions. If you've built something useful:

1. Follow the [skill development best practices](../../best-practices/skill-development.md)
2. Test thoroughly in your environment
3. Document setup, invocation, and expected output
4. Remove environment-specific values (use placeholders)
5. Submit through the catalog contribution process

Skills are reviewed by community maintainers before publication. The review checks for documentation completeness, error handling, security considerations, and community value  --  not whether every edge case is handled (that's what quality tiers communicate).
