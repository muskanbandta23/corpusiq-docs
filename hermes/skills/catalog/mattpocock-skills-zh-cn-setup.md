# Matt Pocock Skills (简体中文) - Setup Guide

**Source:** [skills.sh](https://www.skills.sh/vinvcn/mattpocock-skills-zh-cn) (138.8K combined installs)
**GitHub:** [vinvcn/mattpocock-skills-zh-cn](https://github.com/vinvcn/mattpocock-skills-zh-cn) (3,856⭐, MIT)
**Category:** Engineering Workflow (Localized)
**First Seen:** May 6, 2026 (skills.sh)
**Quality Tier:** 🟢 Production (Gen Agent Trust Hub Pass / Socket Pass / Snyk Pass)

This is the Simplified-Chinese localization of `mattpocock/skills` - Matt Pocock's well-known engineering skill suite (TDD, domain modeling, code review, spec-to-ticket workflows) already documented in the catalog under its English source. The zh-CN fork matters on its own: 138.8K installs make it one of the largest non-English suites on skills.sh, and it adds unique localization tooling - `translate-skill` (localize any skill pack), `setup-matt-pocock-skills`, and Chinese-language grilling/domain-modeling workflows. Skills keep their English names for cross-compatibility; SKILL.md bodies are Chinese.

## Prerequisites

- None - pure prompt-skill suite; works with any runtime that loads skills.sh skills
- Chinese-language SKILL.md content: the agent must be able to follow Chinese instructions

## CorpusIQ Use Cases

- **Chinese-market operator support** - the localized suite lets CorpusIQ agents serve Chinese-speaking operators with native-language engineering workflows
- **Localization pipeline** - `translate-skill` is a reusable workflow for localizing CorpusIQ's own skill packs and docs into zh-CN
- **Spec discipline parity** - the to-spec → to-tickets → to-prd chain matches CorpusIQ's spec-first governance pattern

## Limitations / Verification

- Fork of the already-documented mattpocock/skills (English); upstream changes lag behind the source repo - cross-check against the English catalog entry for the canonical workflow set
- Skills keep English names but Chinese bodies - mixed-language tooling friction in English-first runtimes
- Verify install: `npx skills list | grep grill-me`
