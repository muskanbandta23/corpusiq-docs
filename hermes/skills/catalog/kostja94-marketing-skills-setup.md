## Key Capabilities

### Copywriting Engine
Framework-driven copywriting that adapts to brand voice. Reads `.claude/project-context.md` or `.cursor/project-context.md` on first use to extract positioning, value proposition, and brand voice. Supports five proven frameworks: PAS (Problem-Agitation-Solution), AIDA (Attention-Interest-Desire-Action), BAB (Before-After-Bridge), FAB (Features-Advantages-Benefits), and the 4 U's (Useful, Urgent, Unique, Ultra-specific).

### Programmatic SEO
Generate hundreds or thousands of landing pages from structured data. Combine keyword research, templates, and data sources to create SEO-optimized content at scale. Ideal for directory sites, location pages, and product variant pages.

### Paid Advertising
End-to-end campaign management for Meta and TikTok. Covers creative generation, audience targeting, budget optimization, A/B testing, and performance analysis. Distinct from strategy skills - these are execution-focused.

### Google Search Console API
Direct API access to search performance data - clicks, impressions, CTR, position. Query by page, query, country, device. Monitor indexing status, submit sitemaps, and track core web vitals.
