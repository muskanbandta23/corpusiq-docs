## Why This Matters for Hermes Agents

LaunchDarkly skills transform feature flag management from manual dashboard clicking into agent-native workflows. A Hermes agent with these skills can autonomously audit stale flags, create new ones matching existing patterns, and configure guarded rollouts - all without leaving the codebase context. The **AgentControl** skills are uniquely positioned: they manage LLM prompts themselves as feature-flagged configurations, enabling A/B testing of agent prompts, multi-agent graph orchestration, and online eval attachment.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- A LaunchDarkly account with API access
- An [API access token](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/account/api) with appropriate permissions
- Claude Code, Codex CLI, Cursor, or Hermes agent with MCP support

### Method 1: Claude Code Plugin (recommended)

```bash
# Add LaunchDarkly as a plugin marketplace
/plugin marketplace add launchdarkly/ai-tooling

# Install the plugin (includes all skills + MCP server)
/plugin install launchdarkly@launchdarkly-ai-tooling

# Authenticate the MCP server when prompted
```

### Method 2: skills.sh CLI

```bash
# Install all LaunchDarkly skills
npx skills add launchdarkly/ai-tooling --full-depth -y

# Or install specific skill categories
npx skills add launchdarkly/ai-tooling \
  --skill feature-flags/launchdarkly-flag-discovery \
  --skill feature-flags/launchdarkly-flag-cleanup \
  --skill feature-flags/launchdarkly-flag-create \
  --full-depth -y
```

### Method 3: Cursor Plugin

1. Open Cursor → **Settings > Plugins**
2. Search for **LaunchDarkly** in the marketplace
3. Or install from URL: `https://github.com/launchdarkly/ai-tooling`

### Method 4: Manual Copy

```bash
git clone https://github.com/launchdarkly/ai-tooling.git
cd ai-tooling

# Copy specific skills to your agent's skills directory
cp -r skills/feature-flags/launchdarkly-flag-cleanup ~/.hermes/skills/
cp -r skills/experiments/launchdarkly-experiment-setup ~/.hermes/skills/
```

## Quick Reference

| Workflow | Trigger Phrase |
|----------|---------------|
| Flag audit | "Which feature flags are stale and should be cleaned up?" |
| Flag creation | "Create a feature flag for the new checkout flow" |
| Flag cleanup | "Remove the `new-checkout-flow` feature flag from this codebase" |
| Rollout | "Roll out dark-mode to 25% of users in production" |
| Experiment setup | "Set up an experiment comparing the old vs new recommendation algorithm" |
| Guarded rollout | "Configure a guarded rollout for the payment service migration - 10% traffic, monitor error rate" |
| AgentControl migration | "Migrate our hardcoded support agent prompt to AgentControl" |
| Multi-agent graph | "Create an agent graph that routes product questions to the product agent and billing to the support agent" |

## Usage Examples

### Feature Flag Lifecycle
```
"Audit all feature flags in this repo - which ones are stale?"
"Create a boolean flag called 'new-search-ui' following our existing patterns"
"Wire the flag into the search component and create a PR with the flag change"
"Roll out new-search-ui to 10% of users, monitor for errors"
"Clean up the 'old-search-backend' flag - it's 100% launched everywhere"
```

### Experimentation
```
"Set up an A/B experiment: new recommendation algo vs current - measure conversion rate"
"Choose the right metric type for measuring signup completion rate"
"Instrument the signup flow with a conversion tracking event"
```

### AgentControl (AI Agent Configuration)
```
"Migrate our customer support agent's hardcoded system prompt to AgentControl"
"Create a prompt variation for the support agent with a more empathetic tone"
"Attach an LLM-as-judge evaluator to measure response quality"
"Set up an agent graph: triage agent → routes to product/support/billing specialist agents"
"Create a reusable prompt snippet for our brand voice guidelines"
```

## Verification

```bash
# Verify MCP server is configured
# In Claude Code: /status should show launchdarkly MCP connected

# Quick smoke test - ask the agent:
"List my LaunchDarkly feature flags"
"Show me any stale flags in production"

# AgentControl: verify config management
"Show my AgentControl projects"
```

## Pro Tips

1. **Start with the `onboarding` skill.** It provides an end-to-end setup sequence: MCP configuration → SDK installation → first flag creation. Complete this once and subsequent skills work without friction.

2. **`flag-and-release-change` is the highest-leverage single skill.** It orchestrates the entire PR workflow - deciding whether a change needs a flag, creating it, wiring it into code, and recording the release. Use it as your default entry point for any code change that might need flagging.

3. **AgentControl is LaunchDarkly for LLM prompts.** If you're A/B testing system prompts, managing multi-agent routing, or attaching evals to agent configurations, these skills replace manual prompt engineering workflows with version-controlled, feature-flagged configurations.

4. **The MCP server gives direct flag access.** Unlike skills.sh-only installs that require API token management, the Claude Code plugin and Cursor plugin include the LaunchDarkly MCP server for OAuth-based, keyless authentication.

5. **`launchdarkly-flag-cleanup` uses LaunchDarkly as source of truth.** It checks actual flag states (not just code references) to determine what's safe to remove - preventing the common mistake of removing a flag that's still active in one environment.
