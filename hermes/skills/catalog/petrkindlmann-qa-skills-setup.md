# Petr Kindlmann QA Skills - Setup Guide

**Source:** [skills.sh](https://www.skills.sh/petrkindlmann/qa-skills) (25.3K combined installs)
**GitHub:** [petrkindlmann/qa-skills](https://github.com/petrkindlmann/qa-skills) (102⭐, MIT)
**Category:** QA & Test Automation
**First Seen:** April 1, 2026 (skills.sh)
**Quality Tier:** 🟡 Beta (Gen Agent Trust Hub Warn on `playwright-automation`; Socket Pass / Snyk Pass)

The most comprehensive agent-native QA cluster on skills.sh: 50 skills covering the full testing lifecycle for Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, and any Agent Skills Standard runtime. The flagship `playwright-automation` skill asks discovery questions first (TypeScript vs JS, browsers, existing suite vs fresh, single vs multi-site), then scaffolds a Playwright project; around it sit strategy skills (test-strategy, risk-based-testing, shift-left), generation skills (ai-test-generation, unit-testing), and gates (release-readiness, qa-dashboard, quality-postmortem).

## Prerequisites

- Node.js for Playwright/Cypress suites (TypeScript recommended)
- Browser binaries via `npx playwright install chromium` for E2E work

## CorpusIQ Use Cases

- **Product quality gates** - `release-readiness` + `qa-dashboard` mirror CorpusIQ's pre-publish gate doctrine for product releases, not just content
- **Eval infrastructure** - the ai-qa-review / ai-test-generation patterns complement the corpusiq-agent-eval YAML dataset approach
- **Browser-UI verification** - selector-drift-recovery and visual-testing skills directly serve CorpusIQ's dashboard and connector UI testing
- **Agent-system testing** - agentic-browser-testing and ai-system-testing are rare, directly relevant skills for testing agent products like CorpusIQ itself

## Limitations / Verification

- Gen Agent Trust Hub flags a Warn on the flagship playwright-automation skill - review before production CI
- 50 skills overlap somewhat (qa-start vs qa-do vs qa-project-bootstrap); install flagships, pull others on demand
- Verify install: `npx skills list | grep playwright-automation`
