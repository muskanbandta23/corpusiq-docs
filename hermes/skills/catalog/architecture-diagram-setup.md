Generate professional, dark-themed technical architecture diagrams as standalone HTML files with inline SVG graphics. No external tools, no API keys, no rendering libraries - just write the HTML file and open it in a browser.

---

## Installation

```bash
npx skills add nousresearch/hermes-agent@architecture-diagram
```

---

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Details |
|---|---|
| **Hermes Agent** | Any version |
| **A browser** | To view the generated HTML/SVG files |
| **Nothing else** | No external tools, API keys, or rendering libraries needed |

---

## What It Provides

### Best Suited For

- Software system architecture (frontend / backend / database layers)
- Cloud infrastructure (VPC, regions, subnets, managed services)
- Microservice / service-mesh topology
- Database + API maps, deployment diagrams
- Any tech-infra subject that fits a dark, grid-backed aesthetic

### Not Suited For

- Physics, chemistry, math, biology, or other scientific subjects
- Physical objects (vehicles, hardware, anatomy, cross-sections)
- Floor plans, narrative journeys, educational / textbook-style visuals
- Hand-drawn whiteboard sketches → use `excalidraw` instead
- Animated explainers → use an animation skill

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Install
npx skills add nousresearch/hermes-agent@architecture-diagram

# 2. Describe your architecture to Hermes
# Example: "Generate an architecture diagram for a Next.js app
# with Vercel hosting, Supabase database, and Cloudflare CDN"

# 3. The agent generates an HTML file at the path it reports
# 4. Open in browser
open architecture-diagram.html  # macOS
xdg-open architecture-diagram.html  # Linux
```

---

## How It Works

The skill instructs the agent to generate pure HTML with inline SVG elements. The output is:
- **Self-contained:** Single HTML file, no external dependencies
- **Dark-themed:** Professionally styled with grid background
- **Responsive:** Scales to viewport
- **Shareable:** Send the HTML file directly - opens in any browser

---

## Diagram Features

| Feature | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Color palette** | Dark background (#0d1117), accent borders, muted text |
| **Grid** | Subtle background grid for alignment reference |
| **Layers** | Visual grouping by architectural tier (frontend, backend, data) |
| **Connections** | Animated or dashed lines showing data flow |
| **Labels** | Clean typography on service boxes |
| **Icons** | Simple geometric shapes representing service types |

---

## Verification

After generation, open the HTML in a browser and verify:
- All services/components are labeled correctly
- Data flow arrows point the right direction
- Color coding distinguishes layers
- File opens without errors in Chrome, Firefox, and Safari
