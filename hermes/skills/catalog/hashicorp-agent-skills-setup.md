## Key Capabilities

### Terraform Search and Import
The primary skill enables agents to discover existing cloud resources and import them into Terraform state. This is essential for brownfield adoption: taking over manually provisioned infrastructure and managing it as code. Covers resource discovery, bulk import strategies, and state file management.

### Infrastructure as Code
Terraform workflows for planning, applying, and destroying infrastructure. Module composition and versioning. State management with remote backends. Provider configuration for multi-cloud deployments. Variable management and workspace strategies.

### Packer Image Building
Machine image creation for consistent, reproducible compute environments. Build AWS AMIs, GCP images, and Azure VM images. Provision with shell, Ansible, or configuration management tools. Integrate with CI/CD pipelines for automated image pipelines.

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Install Terraform
brew install terraform

# 2. Add the Terraform skill
npx skills add hashicorp/agent-skills --skill terraform-search-import

# 3. Initialize a Terraform project
mkdir infra && cd infra
terraform init

# 4. Import existing resources
terraform import aws_instance.example i-1234567890abcdef0
```

## Hermes Integration Notes

- **Infrastructure as code:** Use Terraform to provision and manage all CorpusIQ cloud infrastructure declaratively
- **Brownfield adoption:** `terraform-search-import` enables Hermes to bring existing manually-created resources under version control
- **Multi-cloud consistency:** Standardize infrastructure patterns across AWS, GCP, and Azure with Terraform modules
- **Immutable infrastructure:** Packer for building golden images used by CorpusIQ worker nodes and agent runtimes
