  api_tier: "free"              # or "clob" for trading access
  default_markets:
    - "politics"
    - "crypto"
  alert_thresholds:
    volume_spike_pct: 50        # Alert on 50%+ volume increase
    price_move_pct: 10          # Alert on 10%+ price movement
```

```

The agent should return market names, current prices, and 24h volume data.

---

## Pitfalls

- **Not financial advice:** Polymarket prices reflect crowd sentiment - not guaranteed outcomes. The skill provides data, not trading recommendations.
- **API rate limits:** The free tier is limited to 10 requests/minute. Heavy polling or multi-market queries can trigger rate limiting.
- **Market liquidity:** Low-volume markets may have stale or unreliable prices. Always check 24h volume before relying on price data.
- **Geographic restrictions:** Polymarket is not available in all jurisdictions. The skill API may be restricted in certain regions.
- **CLOB API requires wallet:** For trading or order book access, a Polymarket wallet and CLOB API key are required.
