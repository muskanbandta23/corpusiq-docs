**Platform:** Linux, macOS, Windows

Skill Vetter is a security-first pre-install audit tool for OpenClaw skills. Before installing any skill from ClawHub, GitHub, or other sources, it runs a structured red-flag checklist covering permissions requested, suspicious instruction patterns, file access scope, and network/shell access requirements. With a 97% trust score and last audited February 2026.

## Installation

```bash
npx skills add useai-pro/openclaw-skills-security@skill-vetter
```

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| OpenClaw or Hermes Agent | Skill execution environment |
| Skill to vet | A SKILL.md from ClawHub, GitHub, or shared source |

## When to Use

- Before installing a new skill from ClawHub
- When reviewing a SKILL.md from GitHub or other sources
- When someone shares a skill file and you need to assess safety
- Before integrating community skills into production workflows

## Vetting Checklist

The skill audits against these red-flag categories:

| Category | What It Checks |
|----------|---------------|
| **File Access** | Does the skill read/write files? Which directories? |
| **Network Access** | Does it make outbound requests? To which domains? |
| **Shell Access** | Does it execute shell commands? With what privileges? |
| **Permission Scope** | What `allowed-tools` are declared? Are they over-broad? |
| **Suspicious Patterns** | Obfuscated code, encoded payloads, eval/exec usage |
| **Data Exfiltration** | Does it send data off-machine? To where? |
| **Dependency Risk** | External package installs, version pinning, supply chain |

## Output

Produces a conservative manual review with:

- **Trust Score** - overall safety assessment
- **Red Flags** - specific concerns with line references
- **Permission Summary** - what the skill can access
- **Recommendation** - Install, Review Further, or Block

## Trust Score: 97/100
