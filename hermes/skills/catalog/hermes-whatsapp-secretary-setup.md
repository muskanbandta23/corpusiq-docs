A personal WhatsApp secretary skill for Hermes Agent. It reads incoming WhatsApp messages, summarizes threads, drafts replies for your approval, and can schedule messages - all through the Hermes agent interface. Never miss an important WhatsApp message while working, and never type a reply you didn't approve.

## Usage with Hermes Agent

### Daily Workflow

```
"Check my WhatsApp messages"
"Summarize the family group chat"
"Draft a reply to Sarah about the meeting time"
"Schedule a WhatsApp message to the team for tomorrow 9am"
```

### Reply Flow

1. Hermes reads the message
2. Drafts a suggested reply
3. Shows you the draft → **you approve or edit**
4. Only then does it send

```
Hermes: "Sarah asks: 'Can we move the meeting to 3pm?'"

Draft reply: 'Sure Sarah, 3pm works for me. See you then!'

[Approve] [Edit] [Skip]
```

- WhatsApp Web session must be re-authenticated periodically
- Store WhatsApp auth state securely - it grants full message access
- `require_confirmation: true` is strongly recommended for production use
- Messages are processed locally - no third-party server involved
