## Quick Start

1. Install: `npx skills add brightdata/skills`
2. Start with `scrape` and `search` - the highest-install pair
3. Ask: "scrape this site and run a competitive intelligence pass on the pricing table"

## CorpusIQ Use Cases

| Use Case | How |
|---|---|
| **Research sweeps** | scrape + search as a resilient fallback when primary search backends degrade |
| **Competitive research** | competitive-intel and price-comparison for market analysis |
| **SEO work** | seo-audit pairs with our Ahrefs and Search Console connectors |
| **Brand monitoring** | brand-listening for CorpusIQ mentions across the web |

## Limitations / Verification

- Publisher-page install counts verified; individual skill audit pages were not fetched for this multi-skill suite
- Most skills require a paid Bright Data account with proxy allocation
- Scraping must respect robots.txt and site terms - the skills do not override that

```bash
npx skills add brightdata/skills   # verify install works
```
