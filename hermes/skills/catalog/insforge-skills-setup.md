# InsForge Skills - Setup Guide

**Source:** [skills.sh](https://www.skills.sh/insforge/insforge-skills) (144.5K combined installs)
**GitHub:** [insforge/insforge-skills](https://github.com/insforge/insforge-skills) (36⭐, Apache-2.0)
**Category:** Backend-as-a-Service & App Infrastructure
**First Seen:** January 26, 2026 (skills.sh)
**Quality Tier:** 🟡 Beta (Gen Agent Trust Hub Pass / Socket Pass / Snyk Fail on flagship `insforge` skill)

InsForge ("AI Forge") is a backend-as-a-service for AI applications. The cluster splits cleanly: the `insforge` skill covers client-side integration via `@insforge/sdk` (URL + anon key in `.env`), while `insforge-cli` handles all backend infrastructure operations an agent performs from the terminal - creating tables, inspecting schema, deploying functions, managing secrets and storage buckets, configuring payment providers and catalogs, website deployments, cron jobs, and log inspection. One of the largest-install skills.sh clusters not tied to a big-star GitHub repo.

## Installation

```bash
npx skills add insforge/insforge-skills --skill insforge        # client SDK integration
npx skills add insforge/insforge-skills --skill insforge-cli     # backend infra operations
npx skills add insforge/insforge-skills --skill insforge-debug   # debugging InsForge apps
npx skills add insforge/insforge-skills --skill insforge-integrations  # third-party integrations
```

## Core Skills

| Skill | Installs | Use For |
|---|---|---|
| insforge | 38.1K | Client-side SDK integration (`@insforge/sdk`, env setup) |
| insforge-cli | 38.0K | Backend ops: tables, functions, secrets, storage, payments, crons, deploys |
| insforge-debug | 34.3K | Debugging InsForge-backed applications |
| insforge-integrations | 33.6K | Wiring third-party integrations |
| insforge-backend-advisor | 402 | Backend architecture advice on the platform |
| skill-creator | 42 | Authoring new InsForge skills |
| postgres-schema-patterns | 15 | Schema design patterns for the managed Postgres |

## Prerequisites

- InsForge account (URL + anon key for SDK mode; CLI credentials for infra ops)
- Node.js project for SDK integration; `.env` or `.env.local` for Next.js

## CorpusIQ Use Cases

- **Rapid product prototyping** - agent-managed tables, auth, storage, payments, and crons let a CorpusIQ operator stand up a functional product backend in one session
- **Ops-cost benchmark** - InsForge's agent-native BaaS pricing/abstraction is a direct competitive reference for CorpusIQ's own data-connector surface
- **Postgres schema patterns** - the bundled schema-patterns skill is reusable design guidance for any managed-Postgres product work

## Limitations / Verification

- Snyk reports a Fail on the flagship `insforge` skill - review the audit before production use
- 36⭐ repo vs 144.5K installs: adoption runs through skills.sh, not GitHub; vendor docs are thin, the skills ARE the documentation
- Verify install: `npx skills list | grep insforge`

## Security
