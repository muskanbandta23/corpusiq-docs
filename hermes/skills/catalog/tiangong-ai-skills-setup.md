## Quick Start

1. Install: `npx skills add tiangong-ai/skills`
2. Load email-smtp-send for outbound mail automation, or gdelt-events-fetch for event research
3. Ask: "send this transactional email via SMTP and fetch GDELT events mentioning the topic"

## CorpusIQ Use Cases

| Use Case | How |
|---|---|
| **Email automation** | SMTP/IMAP skills compose with our email ops stack as a self-hosted fallback |
| **Research sweeps** | GDELT, regulations.gov, and Federal Register fetching for market research |
| **Brand monitoring** | Bluesky cascade and YouTube comment fetching for channel monitoring |
| **Environmental data** | Open-Meteo, NASA FIRMS, EPA, and USGS skills for data-driven reporting |

## Limitations / Verification

- Multi-skill suite; individual security-audit pages not fetched this sweep
- Long tail is thin (many skills under 100 installs); the email and GDELT skills carry the suite
- Some sources require their own API keys or rate-limit handling

```bash
npx skills add tiangong-ai/skills   # verify install works
```
