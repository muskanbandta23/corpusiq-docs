## Key Skills In Detail

### openclaw-secure-linux-cloud (240K installs)

The highest-install skill in this sweep. Hardens Linux cloud instances for agent deployment: firewall rules, SSH key-only auth, fail2ban, audit logging, and automated security scanning. Essential for production agent deployments.

```bash
hermes skill xixu-me/skills/openclaw-secure-linux-cloud
```

### xiaohongshu (10.6K installs)

Full Xiaohongshu/RED (China's Instagram, 300M+ users) integration. Post content, read feeds, analyze engagement, manage DMs. Critical for any brand with Chinese market presence.

```bash
hermes skill zhjiang22/openclaw-xhs/xiaohongshu
```

### proactive-self-improving-agent (2.5K installs)

Implements a self-improving agent loop: execute → reflect → adapt → repeat. The agent analyzes its own outputs, identifies improvement areas, and updates its approach without human intervention.

## CorpusIQ Use Cases

| Use Case | Skills | Value |
|---|---|---|
| Linux server security hardening | `openclaw-secure-linux-cloud` | Production-grade agent infrastructure security |
| Chinese market expansion | `xiaohongshu` | Reach 300M+ Chinese users |
| Autonomous agent improvement | `proactive-self-improving-agent`, `openclaw-self-healing` | Self-healing and self-improving agent loops |
| Data pipeline enrichment | `playwright-scraper`, `exa-web-search-free`, `finance-news` | Web data extraction without paid APIs |

---

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Fix |
|---|---|
| `openclaw-secure-linux-cloud` blocks SSH | The skill enables key-only auth - ensure your SSH key is in `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` before running |
| `xiaohongshu` login fails | Xiaohongshu requires phone verification - manual login first, then cookie persistence |
| `akshare-stock` data errors | AKShare rate-limits free tier to 10 requests/minute - use `stock-market-pro` for higher throughput |
