## Key Capabilities

### Next.js Auth Patterns (28.1K installs)
Complete Next.js authentication patterns for both App Router and Pages Router. Covers middleware-based route protection, server component auth checks, client-side hooks (`useAuth`, `useUser`), and organization-aware routing. The most-installed Clerk skill for good reason - auth mistakes in Next.js are common and costly.

### Custom UI (26.6K installs)
Build fully custom authentication interfaces using Clerk Elements. Move beyond pre-built `<SignIn />` components to branded, custom-designed auth flows while maintaining Clerk's security guarantees. Covers component composition, theming, and responsive design.

### Backend API (25.1K installs)
Server-side authentication patterns: protect API routes with `auth()`, validate sessions in middleware, manage user metadata, handle organization-level permissions. Includes patterns for Express, Hono, and Next.js Route Handlers.

### Webhooks (25.0K installs)
Event-driven user management: sync user data to your database on `user.created`, trigger onboarding on first sign-in, handle organization membership changes. Includes webhook signature verification and idempotency patterns.

### Testing (24.1K installs)
Test authenticated application flows without manual login. Create test users via Clerk API, mock sessions in unit tests, write E2E tests that navigate protected routes. Covers Jest, Vitest, Playwright, and Cypress patterns.

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Add the setup skill to a project
npx skills add clerk/skills --skill clerk-setup

# 2. Have your agent set up Clerk
claude "Using the clerk-setup skill, integrate Clerk authentication into this Next.js app"

# 3. Add custom UI
npx skills add clerk/skills --skill clerk-custom-ui
claude "Using the clerk-custom-ui skill, replace the default sign-in page with our brand's design"

# 4. Add testing
npx skills add clerk/skills --skill clerk-testing
claude "Using the clerk-testing skill, write E2E tests for the authenticated dashboard"
```

---

## Verification

```bash
# Check installed Clerk skills
npx skills list | grep clerk/skills

# Verify Clerk integration
npx skills use clerk/skills@clerk-setup
```

## Notes

- Clerk skills are framework-aware - `clerk-nextjs-patterns` targets Next.js specifically while `clerk-backend-api` is framework-agnostic
- The combined install count (156K+) makes this the most-installed authentication skill set on skills.sh
- For Hermes agents building SaaS applications: use `clerk-setup` + `clerk-nextjs-patterns` to get auth right on the first attempt
- Clerk's free tier supports 10,000 monthly active users - sufficient for most early-stage applications
- Pair with `makenotion/skills` or `airtable/skills` for full-stack SaaS agent capabilities
