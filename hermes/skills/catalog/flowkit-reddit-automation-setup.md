# FlowKit Reddit Automation - Setup Guide

**Source:** [flowkit-labs/skills](https://www.skills.sh/flowkit-labs/skills) (1 skill · 5.4K installs)
**Repo:** [github.com/flowkit-labs/skills](https://github.com/flowkit-labs/skills)

**First Seen:** August 13, 2026
**Quality Tier:** 🟢 Production (5.4K installs, +110 in one hour during the August 13 sweep)

`reddit-automation` was the second-hottest social skill on skills.sh during the August 13 sweep, gaining installs faster than any skill except AI video generation. It packages the full Reddit engagement loop - finding relevant threads, drafting help-first replies, and posting - as procedural knowledge an agent can follow with its existing Reddit credentials.

## Core Skills

| Skill | Installs | Use For |
|---|---|---|
| `reddit-automation` | 5.4K | Reddit monitoring, reply drafting, and posting workflows |

---

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Details |
|---|---|

| Node.js + npx | For the skills.sh CLI install path |
| Help-first discipline | Reddit bans self-promotion - replies must solve problems first |

---

## CorpusIQ Use Cases

| Use Case | How |
|---|---|
| **Community monitoring** | Track SaaS, data, and ecommerce subreddits for relevant threads |
| **Help-first replies** | Answer real operator questions with useful, non-promotional answers |
| **Signal mining** | Find pain points for product research and content ideas |

---

## Limitations / Verification

- Reddit's automation detection is aggressive - keep reply volume human-scale (5/day or fewer)
- Pair with your own credential setup; this skill is procedural, not a credential gateway
- Verify install: `npx skills list | grep reddit`
