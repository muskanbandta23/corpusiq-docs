# Planning With Files - Setup Guide

**Quality Tier:** 🟢 Production (framework-agnostic)

A planning methodology skill for agents working on long, multi-step tasks: persist a task plan, findings, and decisions to files on disk instead of holding everything in context. This is the skills.sh-ecosystem answer to context loss on long sessions - the agent re-reads its plan files each turn, so interrupted or context-compacted runs resume cleanly. Multilingual: Arabic, German, Spanish, Simplified and Traditional Chinese, plus a personal-intelligence variant (`pi-planning-with-files`).

## Prerequisites

- No dependencies - pure procedural knowledge; works with any agent that can read/write files
- Best paired with a workspace directory the agent owns

## CorpusIQ Use Cases

- **Cron resilience** - file-plan persistence is the exact pattern CorpusIQ crons use (handoff pages, state files); this skill formalizes it for any long-running agent task
- **Session handoff** - complements the Honcho/GBrain session-handoff ritual with a lightweight on-disk plan for task continuity
- **Localized support** - the zh/es/de/ar editions support multilingual operator teams

## Limitations / Verification

- Methodology only - no enforcement; the agent must actually follow its own plan files
- Verify: start a task, confirm the plan file is written, interrupt, and confirm the next run resumes from the plan
