# Agent Flywheel Mega-Toolkit Setup Guide

**Published by:** [dicklesworthstone](https://github.com/dicklesworthstone) | **Repo:** [agent_flywheel_clawdbot_skills_and_integrations](https://github.com/dicklesworthstone/agent_flywheel_clawdbot_skills_and_integrations)
**Skills:** 25+ | **Combined installs:** 2,201 | **Compatible with:** Hermes Agent, ClawDBot, OpenClaw

## Overview

The Agent Flywheel is the most comprehensive single-publisher ClawDBot/Hermes toolkit discovered to date. It covers the complete agent operations lifecycle - from SSH server access to multi-agent swarming, browser automation, code quality enforcement, Discord/email communication, and terminal workflows. Built by a developer who also maintains pi_agent_rust, beads_rust, and eidetic_engine_cli (agent infrastructure repos), these skills are production-tested and designed for real workload automation.

**What makes this different:** Most skill collections focus on a single domain (marketing, coding, deployment). The Agent Flywheel covers ALL domains - infrastructure, orchestration, communication, development, design, and terminal - under one publisher with consistent conventions.

### Skill Categories

| **Browser** | claude-chrome (81) | Web browsing and automation |
| **Design** | ui-ux-polish (202), de-slopify (88) | UI refinement, content cleanup |
| **Terminal** | ghostty (57), wezterm (54), building-glamorous-tuis (67*) | Terminal emulators and TUIs |
| **Database** | supabase (61) | Database operations |
| **Security** | csctf (56) | CTF and security workflows |
| **Utilities** | cass (80), bv (70), ubs (64), cm (62), ntm (58), dcg (56), caam (53), slb (51), giil (50), ru (51) | Code quality, workflows, helpers |

*Note: building-glamorous-tuis is from dicklesworthstone/meta_skill (67 installs), compatible with the same agent setup.

## Key Skills in Detail

### ssh (652 installs)
SSH server access and command execution for Hermes agents. Enables agents to connect to remote servers, run commands, transfer files, and manage infrastructure.

**Configuration:**
```bash
# SSH key must be available in agent's environment
export SSH_KEY_PATH=~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

**Hermes use:** Server maintenance, deployment verification, log retrieval from production.

### agent-swarm-workflow (156 installs)
Multi-agent coordination pattern. Enables Hermes to spawn and manage sub-agents for parallel task execution - research in parallel, divide-and-conquer code generation, multi-perspective analysis.

**Hermes use:** Complex research tasks, parallel data processing, multi-source content generation. Pairs with CorpusIQ's own [supervisor-agent](/hermes/orchestration/) patterns.

### claude-chrome (81 installs)
Browser automation through Chrome. Enables Hermes agents to navigate websites, fill forms, extract data, and interact with web UIs.

**Hermes use:** Web scraping, form automation, SaaS tool interaction without APIs, competitive research.

### agent-mail (77 installs)
Email sending and receiving through Gmail API. Agents can read inbox, send replies, and manage email workflows autonomously.

**Configuration:**
```bash
# Requires Gmail API OAuth credentials
export GMAIL_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
export GMAIL_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
export GMAIL_REFRESH_TOKEN=your_refresh_token
```

**Hermes use:** Automated email monitoring, customer support triage, newsletter drafting.

### supabase (61 installs)
Database operations through Supabase. CRUD operations, real-time subscriptions, and auth management.

**Configuration:**
```bash
export SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
export SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key
export SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key
```

**Hermes use:** Application backend, data storage for agent workflows, user management.

## Installation Strategy

**Tier 1 - Core Infrastructure (install first):**
- ssh, gcloud, vercel - server and deployment access
- github - code management

**Tier 2 - Agent Capabilities (high value):**
- agent-swarm-workflow, planning-workflow - multi-agent orchestration
- claude-chrome - web browsing
- agent-mail, flywheel-discord - communication channels

**Tier 3 - Quality and Polish:**
- de-slopify, ui-ux-polish - content and design refinement
- cass, csctf - code quality and security

**Tier 4 - Specialized Tools (install as needed):**
- supabase - database access
- ghostty, wezterm - terminal customization
- tanstack-integration - frontend development

---

## CorpusIQ Use Cases

1. **Growth Operations:** Use `claude-chrome` + `de-slopify` for competitive research and content refinement. Use `agent-mail` for automated outreach monitoring.

2. **Multi-Agent Research:** `agent-swarm-workflow` + `planning-workflow` for parallel market research across multiple data sources.

3. **Infrastructure Automation:** `ssh` + `gcloud` for managing agent workstations and worker nodes.

4. **Community Management:** `flywheel-discord` for Discord community engagement, `agent-mail` for email support.

5. **Code Quality:** `github` + `cass` for automated PR review and code quality enforcement.

## Troubleshooting

### SSH connection failures
Verify the SSH key is in the agent's environment and has correct permissions (`chmod 600`). Test with `ssh -T user@host` before delegating to the agent.

### Discord bot not responding
Ensure `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` is set and the bot has been invited to the target server with appropriate permissions (Send Messages, Read Message History).

### Gmail API quota exceeded
Gmail API has a 1,000,000 unit/day quota for free tier. Batch email operations and use push notifications instead of polling.

### Agent swarm spawning too many sub-agents
The `agent-swarm-workflow` skill supports a `--max-agents` parameter. Set to a reasonable limit for your hardware (start with 3-5).
