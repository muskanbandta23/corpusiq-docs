# GPT-Image-2 Style Library - Setup Guide

**Source:** [freestylefly/awesome-gpt-image-2](https://skills.sh/freestylefly/awesome-gpt-image-2)
**GitHub:** [freestylefly/awesome-gpt-image-2](https://github.com/freestylefly/awesome-gpt-image-2) (14,716⭐, MIT, active through Aug 24, 2026)
**Skills:** 1 skill (gpt-image-2-style-library), 1.5K installs
**Category:** Creative / Image Generation
**First Seen:** August 24, 2026 sweep (skills.sh first-listed May 8, 2026)
**Quality Tier:** 🟢 Production - 14.7K-star MIT repo, clean Gen Agent Trust Hub / Socket / Snyk audits (all Pass)

The gpt-image-2-style-library skill wraps the awesome-gpt-image-2 knowledge base ("Prompt as Code" - a 530+ case reverse-engineered library with 20+ industrial prompt templates) as a loadable agent skill. An agent that needs to generate or edit images picks a named visual style and an industrial template instead of improvising a prompt from scratch - the difference between "make it look nice" and a reproducible, style-pinned image.

This is a direct match for the Hermes `image_generate` tool, whose active backend is gpt-image-2 (OpenAI gpt-image-2-medium): the library's styles and templates are written against exactly that model family.

## Installation

The maintained-checkout pattern (recommended - keeps the skill updateable with `git pull`):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/freestylefly/awesome-gpt-image-2.git
```

```yaml
# ~/.hermes/config.yaml
skills:
  external_dirs:
    - /absolute/path/to/awesome-gpt-image-2
```

Or via the skills.sh marketplace:

```bash
npx skills add freestylefly/awesome-gpt-image-2
```

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Details |
|---|---|
| **GPT-Image-2 access** | The skill is a style/prompt library, not an API client - pair it with any gpt-image-2-capable backend (Hermes image_generate, OpenAI API, or a Claude Code image tool) |
| **A target use case** | Styles are selected by task: product shots, thumbnails, avatars, marketing banners, UI mockups |

## Core Skill

| Skill | Installs | Use For |
|---|---|---|
| gpt-image-2-style-library | 1.5K | Choose GPT-Image-2 visual styles and industrial prompt templates from the awesome-gpt-image-2 library - 530+ reverse-engineered cases, 20+ industrial templates; use when an agent needs to create, edit, or restyle images with a reproducible look |

## Security Audit Status (skills.sh, verified Aug 24, 2026)

| Skill | Gen Agent Trust Hub | Socket | Snyk |
|---|---|---|---|
| gpt-image-2-style-library | Pass | Pass | Pass |

## CorpusIQ Use Cases

| Use Case | How |
|---|---|
| **Brand-consistent image generation** | Pin a named style for CorpusIQ social and report imagery instead of per-prompt improvisation - reproducible look across all agent-generated images |
| **Prompt quality floor** | The 530+ case library is a reference corpus for auditing our own image prompts: what industrial templates do for composition, lighting, and text rendering |
| **Hermes image_generate pairing** | The active Hermes image backend is gpt-image-2-medium - this library's styles and templates are written against that model family, so results translate one-to-one |

## Limitations / Verification

- The skill is a knowledge library - it does not generate images itself; a gpt-image-2-capable backend is required.
- Repo description is Chinese-first ("Prompt as Code - GPT-Image2 industrial prompt engine"); the skill body and template names are usable directly, but expect mixed-language reference material.
- Install counts are modest (1.5K) relative to the repo's 14.7K stars - the skill is a thin wrapper over the starred knowledge base, which is the real asset.
