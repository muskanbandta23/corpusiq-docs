# n8n Skills - Setup Guide

n8n is the open-source workflow automation platform business operators use to connect their stack without code. These skills make an agent fluent in building, debugging, and hardening n8n workflows - including MCP tool integration, which bridges directly into the Hermes MCP ecosystem. Two complementary repos: the community suite (15 skills, 48.4K) is broader and workflow-focused; the official repo (14 skills) encodes n8n's own best practices.

---

## Installation

```bash
# Community suite (recommended starting point)
npx skills add czlonkowski/n8n-skills

# Official n8n skills
npx skills add n8n-io/skills
```

No API key required for the skills themselves. Building real workflows needs an n8n instance - cloud (n8n.io), self-hosted (`n8n-self-hosting` skill covers it), or local via Docker/npx.

### n8n-io/skills (official, 14 skills)

`n8n-workflow-lifecycle-official`, `n8n-agents-official`, `n8n-debugging-official`, `n8n-code-nodes-official`, `n8n-error-handling-official`, `n8n-credentials-and-security-official`, `using-n8n-skills-official`, `n8n-expressions-official`, `n8n-node-configuration-official`, `n8n-loops-official`, `n8n-subworkflows-official`, `n8n-binary-and-data-official`, `n8n-data-tables-official`, `n8n-extending-mcp-official` - official guidance mirroring the community suite's topics.

## Quick Start

1. `npx skills add czlonkowski/n8n-skills`
2. Stand up a local instance: `docker run -it --rm -p 5678:5678 n8nio/n8n`
3. "Design a workflow that watches a form submission, enriches the lead with web research, and posts a Slack alert"
4. "Review this workflow JSON for errors before I activate it"
5. "Add an MCP tool node that calls a CorpusIQ connector"

## CorpusIQ Use Cases

| Use Case | How |
|---|---|
| **Operator enablement** | Business operators live in n8n - these skills let us spec and ship automations for them, strengthening the CorpusIQ operator platform thesis |
| **MCP bridge** | `n8n-mcp-tools-expert` + `n8n-extending-mcp-official` document calling MCP tools from n8n - the same protocol CorpusIQ connectors speak |
| **Internal automations** | Draft and validate n8n workflows for internal ops before handoff to the dev team |
| **Inbound lead answers** | Answer "can CorpusIQ help me automate X in n8n" questions with working workflow designs |

## Limitations / Verification

- Skills are guidance workflows, not an n8n deployment - you need an n8n instance (cloud or self-hosted) for execution
- Community repo is third-party maintained; cross-check against the official repo where topics overlap
- `n8n-self-hosting` assumes Docker or npm hosting experience

```bash
# Verify local n8n instance (default port 5678)
curl -s http://localhost:5678/healthz
```
