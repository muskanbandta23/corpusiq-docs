# OpenClaw Secure Linux Cloud - Setup Guide

**Source:** [xixu-me/skills](https://skills.sh/xixu-me/skills) (244K installs)
**Category:** Infrastructure / Security
**Skill:** openclaw-secure-linux-cloud

A comprehensive skill for deploying OpenClaw (and by extension Hermes) agents on hardened Linux cloud instances. Covers firewall configuration, SSH hardening, process isolation, and automated security patching - the production deployment blueprint for cloud-hosted agents.

---

## Installation

```bash
npx skills add xixu-me/skills --skill openclaw-secure-linux-cloud
```

---

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Details |
|---|---|
| **Linux cloud instance** | Ubuntu 22.04/24.04 LTS, Debian 12, or RHEL 9 compatible |
| **SSH access** | Root or sudo-capable user |
| **Cloud provider account** | AWS, GCP, Azure, or any VPS provider |
| **Domain (optional)** | For TLS certificate provisioning |
| **Hermes Agent** | Installed on the target instance |

---

## Key Capabilities

### Security Hardening

| Capability | How to Trigger | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Firewall configuration | "Harden the firewall" or "Configure ufw for OpenClaw" | Sets up ufw with allowlist-only inbound rules |
| SSH hardening | "Harden SSH" | Disables root login, password auth; enforces key-only + fail2ban |
| Process isolation | "Isolate OpenClaw processes" | systemd service with PrivateTmp, ProtectSystem, NoNewPrivileges |
| Audit logging | "Enable audit logging" | Configures auditd for agent actions |

### Deployment

| Capability | How to Trigger | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Cloud provisioning | "Provision a secure OpenClaw instance on [provider]" | Terraform/cloud-init patterns for major providers |
| Auto-patching | "Set up unattended security upgrades" | Automatic security patching with reboot scheduling |
| TLS setup | "Configure TLS for OpenClaw" | Let's Encrypt certbot automation with auto-renewal |
| Backup strategy | "Configure agent backups" | Automated config + data backup to cloud storage |

---

## CorpusIQ Use Cases

| Use Case | How |
|---|---|
| **Production Hermes deployment** | Deploy a hardened Hermes instance on any cloud provider with firewall, TLS, and auto-patching |
| **Multi-agent infrastructure** | Scale to multiple isolated agent instances per customer/tenant with process isolation |
| **Compliance-ready hosting** | Audit logging + access controls for SOC 2 / CASA Tier 2 aligned deployments |
| **Disaster recovery** | Automated backup configuration ensures agent state survives instance failures |
| **Client deployments** | Provision secure agent instances for CorpusIQ enterprise clients with zero-touch setup |

---

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Fix |
|---|---|
| Firewall blocks legitimate agent traffic | Check `ufw status verbose` - add specific port with `ufw allow <port>/tcp` |
| SSH locked out after hardening | Use cloud provider console (serial console / rescue mode). The skill saves original sshd_config as `.bak` |
| TLS renewal fails | Certbot requires port 80 open during renewal. Ensure `ufw allow 80/tcp` is active during renewal window |
| Process isolation too restrictive | Review the generated systemd unit file. Adjust `ProtectSystem` and `ReadWritePaths` as needed |

---

## Verification

```bash
# Verify skill installed
hermes skills list | grep openclaw-secure-linux-cloud

# After deployment, verify hardening
ssh root@<instance> "ufw status verbose && systemctl status openclaw && fail2ban-client status sshd"

# Check TLS
curl -sI https://<domain> | head -1
# Should return HTTP/2 200 or similar
```
