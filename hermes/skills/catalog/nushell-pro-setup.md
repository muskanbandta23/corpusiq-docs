# NuShell Pro - Setup Guide

**Source:** [hustcer/nushell-pro](https://www.skills.sh/hustcer/nushell-pro) (2 skills · 1.1K combined installs)

`nushell-pro` encodes NuShell expertise - structured data pipelines, custom command design, and typed shell automation - for agents that script system administration tasks. NuShell's data-centric model (everything is a table) maps well to agent pipelines that currently fight text-parsing in bash. `nushell-craft` is the newer, still-experimental companion.
