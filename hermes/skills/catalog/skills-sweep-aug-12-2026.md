## Skill Details

### 1. heartmula (224 installs)
Open-source AI music generation with HeartMuLa models (Apache 2.0). Four-model pipeline: HeartMuLa (3B/7B music LM), HeartCodec (12.5Hz audio codec), HeartTranscriptor (Whisper-based lyrics), HeartCLAP (audio-text alignment). Suno/Udio alternative - local, offline, no API keys.

### 2. simplify-code (187 installs)
Parallel code review with four focused reviewers running concurrently: Reuse (DRY), Quality (maintainability), Efficiency (performance), Altitude (architecture). Cleanup pass, not bug hunt - removes duplication, flattens complexity, cuts waste. Each reviewer runs in parallel.

### 3. ideation (111 installs)
Constraint-driven creative ideation. Generates 3 concrete project ideas from a creative constraint library, then builds the chosen one. Philosophy: constraint + direction = creativity. Works for code, art, hardware, tools.

### 4. subagent-driven-development (88 installs)
Multi-agent development workflow. Dispatches fresh subagents per task with systematic two-stage review (spec compliance then quality). Clean context per task, automated gating between steps. Consumes `plan` skill output.

### 5. linear (80 installs)
Linear.app integration via GraphQL API using curl. No MCP server, no OAuth - just an API key. Manage issues, projects, sprints, and team workloads from Hermes. Both UUID and short IDs (ENG-123) work.

### 6. webhook-subscriptions (80 installs)
External service webhook triggers for Hermes. GitHub pushes, Stripe events, CI/CD completions become agent triggers. HMAC signature verification, per-subscription routing, dynamic subscription management.

### 7. grounded-citations (22 installs)
Perplexity-style inline citations with verifiable source chains. Ledger-owned `url → [n]` mapping, verbatim quote verification, `[unverified]` flagging for model knowledge. `verify --evidence` command for fact-checking. Integrates with `research-paper-writing`.
