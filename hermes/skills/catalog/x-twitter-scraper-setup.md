**Category:** social, data

Comprehensive X/Twitter automation skill for Hermes Agent. Covers the full Twitter API surface: tweet search, advanced search, profile tweets, user lookup, follower export, media download, posting, replies, DMs, giveaway draws, account monitoring, webhooks, 23 bulk extraction tools, MCP integration, the Hermes Tweet plugin, and the TweetClaw OpenClaw plugin.

---

## Installation

```bash
npx skills add sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills --skill x-twitter-scraper
```

This is a documentation-only skill - it doesn't bundle executable code. The external tools (Xquik, Hermes Tweet plugin, TweetClaw) must be installed separately.

| **Hermes Tweet Plugin** | For `tweet_explore`, `tweet_read`, `tweet_action` tools |

| **Hermes Agent** | Any recent version with plugin support |

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Fix |
|---|---|
| "Xquik API key required" | Register at xquik.com and set `XQUIK_API_KEY` env var |
| Posting blocked | tweet_action requires explicit user approval per Hermes security model |
| Rate limiting | X/Twitter API has rate limits; use bulk extraction for large datasets |
| Webhook not firing | Verify webhook URL is publicly accessible (use ngrok for local dev) |
| Hermes Tweet plugin not found | Install separately: check plugin directory at `~/.hermes/profiles/<name>/plugins/` |

## Verification

```bash
# Verify skill installed
hermes skills list | grep x-twitter-scraper

# Test tweet search (read-only, no auth needed for basic search)
# Ask Hermes: "search X for 'hermes agent' and show me the top 5 results"

# Verify Hermes Tweet plugin (if installed)
hermes tweet_explore --query "test" --count 1
```
