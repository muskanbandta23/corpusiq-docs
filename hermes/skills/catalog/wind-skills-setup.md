Wind Information is China's Bloomberg-equivalent - the dominant financial data terminal for Chinese markets (A-shares, bonds, funds, macro). This official cluster gives agents two things: MCP-based access to Wind's data feeds, and a large library of investment-research workflows (DCF models, valuation snapshots, backtests, post-market debriefs, earnings analysis). The strongest signal for agent-native institutional finance from an Asian data vendor to date.

## Prerequisites

- Wind terminal account or Wind MCP access (data skills require credentials)
- For A-share data: mainland China data-access terms apply

## CorpusIQ Use Cases

- **Business-data connector parity** - Wind's MCP pattern is a reference architecture for CorpusIQ's own multi-connector endpoint; study how they expose terminal data to agents
- **Finance vertical intelligence** - research workflows (DCF, earnings analysis) as templates for finance-focused CorpusIQ users
- **Market-ecosystem insight** - the persona-avatar skills show how established finance vendors package reasoning frameworks for agents

## Limitations / Verification

- Data access is gated by Wind credentials; the research skills work standalone with any data source
- Verify: `wind-mcp-skill` MCP endpoint returns a dataset query successfully before relying on it
