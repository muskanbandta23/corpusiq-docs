## Key Capabilities

### Personal Productivity
Lenny's personal operating system: ideal week design, energy-based task scheduling, meeting reduction frameworks, and deep work block protection. Based on systems used by top tech operators.

### Competitive Analysis
Structured competitive intelligence: feature comparison matrices, positioning maps, SWOT analysis, and "jobs to be done" competitive alternatives. Based on frameworks from Lenny's competitive analysis playbook.

### PRD Writing
Product requirements documentation with problem-first structure: user pain → current alternatives → proposed solution → success metrics → MVP scope. Includes stakeholder alignment patterns and prioritization frameworks (RICE, ICE).

### Brand Storytelling
Develop brand narratives: mission statement, positioning vs alternatives, brand voice guidelines, customer story arcs, and messaging hierarchy. Based on storytelling patterns from Lenny's brand-building episodes.

### Startup Ideation
Systematic idea generation: problem-space mapping, customer segment identification, solution brainstorming with constraints, and rapid validation checklist. Filters ideas through desirability, feasibility, and viability lenses.

### Vibe Coding
Rapid prototyping methodology: start with the user experience, iterate visually, defer architecture decisions, and validate with users before engineering. "Vibe first, code second" approach popularized by AI-assisted development.
