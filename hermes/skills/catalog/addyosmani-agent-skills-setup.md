## Key Capabilities

### CI/CD & Automation (ci-cd-and-automation)
The flagship skill at 14.1K installs. Automates GitHub Actions workflow creation, deployment pipeline configuration, artifact management, and release automation. Handles multi-environment deployments with approval gates and rollback strategies.

### Code Quality & Review
- **code-review-and-quality**: Automated code review with style, security, and performance checks
- **code-simplification**: Identifies over-engineered code and proposes simpler alternatives
- **source-driven-development**: Reads and analyzes existing code before making changes - prevents breaking patterns

### Performance & Observability
- **performance-optimization**: Core Web Vitals optimization, bundle analysis, render performance
- **observability-and-instrumentation**: OpenTelemetry integration, structured logging, custom metrics
- **browser-testing-with-devtools**: Performance profiling, memory leak detection, network waterfall analysis

### Security & Launch
- **security-and-hardening**: Dependency scanning, secret detection, OWASP Top 10 mitigation
- **shipping-and-launch**: Production readiness checklist, feature flags, canary deployments
- **test-driven-development**: Red-green-refactor with Jest, Vitest, and Playwright

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Details |
|---|---|
| **Node.js** | 18+ |
| **GitHub CLI** | For ci-cd-and-automation (Actions workflows) |
| **Chrome/Chromium** | For browser-testing-with-devtools |
| **Docker** | Optional - for isolated test environments |

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Install the most-used skill
npx skills add addyosmani/agent-skills --skill ci-cd-and-automation

# 2. Trigger in Hermes - the skill loads when its conditions match
# Example: "Set up a CI/CD pipeline for this repo" triggers ci-cd-and-automation
# Example: "Review this PR for security issues" triggers security-and-hardening

# 3. Verify installation
npx skills list | grep addyosmani
```

---

## Verification

```bash
# Check installed skills
npx skills list | grep "ci-cd-and-automation"

# Test - ask Hermes a relevant engineering question
# "Create a GitHub Actions workflow that runs tests and deploys to staging"
```

## Notes

- Authored by **Addy Osmani**, Google Chrome Engineering Lead - these skills encode production patterns used at Google scale
- The **ci-cd-and-automation** skill is the most popular (14.1K installs) and the primary entry point
- Skills are designed to compose together - e.g., combine `test-driven-development` → `code-review-and-quality` → `ci-cd-and-automation` for a complete quality pipeline
- **context-engineering** is particularly relevant for Hermes agents - it teaches agents to manage their own context windows efficiently
- These skills complement the existing `security-and-hardening-setup` and `ci-cd` catalog entries but add Addy's specific production-grade patterns
- GitHub topics include: `agent-skills`, `antigravity`, `claude-code`, `codex`, `cursor` - indicating multi-agent compatibility
