## Key Capabilities

### Wrangler CLI
The primary interface for deploying and managing Cloudflare Workers. Covers `wrangler deploy`, `wrangler dev` (local development), `wrangler tail` (live logs), KV namespace management, R2 bucket operations, D1 database migrations, secret management, and environment configuration.

### Workers Best Practices
Production-grade patterns for Cloudflare Workers including error handling with `fetch` event lifecycle, smart caching strategies with Cache API, routing patterns for multi-worker architectures, performance profiling with `wrangler tail`, and cost optimization through request minimization.

### Web Performance
End-to-end web performance optimization using Cloudflare's CDN: automatic image resizing and format conversion (WebP/AVIF), tiered caching strategies, HTTP/3 and 0-RTT configuration, Early Hints for preload/preconnect, and performance budget enforcement.

### MCP Server Deployment
Step-by-step guide for deploying MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers on Cloudflare Workers. Covers SSE transport over Workers, Durable Object-backed state management, D1 for persistent storage, and integration with Claude Desktop and other MCP clients.

### Agents SDK
Build stateful AI agents using Cloudflare's Agents SDK with Durable Objects for session state. Supports WebSocket-based real-time communication, agent-to-agent coordination, and deployment across Cloudflare's global edge network.

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Install Wrangler CLI
npm install -g wrangler

# 2. Authenticate with Cloudflare
wrangler login

# 3. Add the wrangler skill
npx skills add cloudflare/skills --skill wrangler

# 4. Add Workers best practices
npx skills add cloudflare/skills --skill workers-best-practices

# 5. Deploy your first Worker
npx wrangler init my-agent-worker
cd my-agent-worker
npx wrangler deploy
```

## Hermes Integration Notes

- **Deploy MCP servers at the edge:** Use `building-mcp-server-on-cloudflare` to deploy CorpusIQ MCP servers globally with sub-50ms latency
- **Anti-bot for growth operations:** `turnstile-spin` provides CAPTCHA-free bot protection for CorpusIQ landing pages and tools
- **Edge caching for docs:** `web-perf` optimizes corpusiq-docs delivery across Cloudflare's CDN
- **Stateful agent backends:** `agents-sdk` + `durable-objects` enables real-time, stateful agent coordination at the edge
- **Zero Trust security:** `cloudflare-one` secures Hermes agent communication channels with Cloudflare Access
