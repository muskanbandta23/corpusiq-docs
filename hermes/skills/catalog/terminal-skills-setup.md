## Key Capabilities

### Cron - Scheduled Task Management
```bash
# View current crontab
crontab -l

# Edit crontab
crontab -e

# Common schedules
0 * * * * command       # Hourly at minute 0
*/15 * * * * command    # Every 15 minutes
0 9-17 * * * command    # Business hours, hourly
0 0 * * 1-5 command     # Weekdays at midnight
```
Ideal for creating and debugging Hermes cron jobs, understanding schedule syntax, and monitoring cron logs for failures.

### Systemd - Service Management
```bash
# Service lifecycle
systemctl status <service>
systemctl start/stop/restart <service>
systemctl enable/disable <service>

# Log inspection
journalctl -u <service> --no-pager -n 50
```
Directly applicable to managing the Hermes gateway service, debugging death loops, and authoring systemd unit files.

### Network Tools - Diagnostics
```bash
# Connectivity checks
ping -c 4 <host>
traceroute <host>

# Port scanning
ss -tlnp                    # Listening ports
nmap -sT <host>             # TCP port scan

# DNS
dig <domain>
nslookup <domain>
```
Useful for debugging Telegram API connectivity, MCP server reachability, and API endpoint health.

### System Admin - General Operations
Disk usage, process management, user management, package installation, and log rotation patterns for day-to-day Hermes system maintenance.

## Quick Start for Hermes Agents

```bash
# 1. Verify installation
npx skills list | grep terminal-skills

# 2. Inspect current cron jobs (using cron skill knowledge)
crontab -l 2>/dev/null || echo "No user crontab"

# 3. Check Hermes gateway service status (using systemd skill knowledge)
systemctl --user status hermes-gateway-corpusiq.service --no-pager

# 4. Network health check (using network-tools skill knowledge)
ss -tlnp | grep -E '11434|8080|3000'
```

---

## Verification

```bash
# Check skills are installed
npx skills list 2>&1 | grep -E 'cron|system-admin|systemd|network-tools|vpn'

# Verify cron knowledge is accessible
npx skills use chaterm/terminal-skills@cron 2>&1 | head -20

# Verify systemd knowledge
npx skills use chaterm/terminal-skills@systemd 2>&1 | head -20
```

## Notes

- **Language**: Primary documentation is in Chinese (zh-CN). Commands, paths, and syntax are universal. Use with translation tools if needed.
- **Hermes integration**: These skills complement but don't replace Hermes' built-in terminal access. They provide structured knowledge for recurring administration patterns.
- **Overlap with existing skills**: The `linux-systemd` and `cron-design-workflow` skills in the CorpusIQ catalog cover similar ground with English documentation. These terminal-skills provide additional patterns and Chinese-language alternatives.
- **VPN skill**: Useful when Hermes needs to connect through VPNs for geo-restricted API access or testing.
