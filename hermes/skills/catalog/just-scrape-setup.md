```bash
just-scrape scrape "https://example.com" --json
```
Extracts markdown, HTML, screenshots, links, images, summaries, or branding from a single URL. Perfect for competitive analysis and content research.

### Extract - Structured JSON from known URLs

just-scrape extract "https://example.com/products" \
  --prompt "Extract product names and prices" \
  --schema '{"products": [{"name": "string", "price": "number"}]}' \
  --json
```
AI-powered extraction with custom prompt and optional JSON schema for structured data.

### Crawl - Bulk extract site sections

Crawls entire documentation sites, blogs, or product catalogs.

## Notes

- **Credit-based pricing**: Each operation consumes ScrapeGraph AI credits. Monitor with `just-scrape credits` before large crawls.
- **Alternatives**: For simple single-page scraping, Hermes' built-in `web_extract` tool may suffice. Use just-scrape when you need structured extraction, multi-page crawling, or scheduled monitoring.
- **API key**: Store `SGAI_API_KEY` in `~/.hermes/profiles/corpusiq/secrets/` alongside other API keys for consistent secret management.
- **Complementary skills**: Works well with `firecrawl`, `tavily-research`, and `web-scraping-gooseworks` for a complete web intelligence stack.
