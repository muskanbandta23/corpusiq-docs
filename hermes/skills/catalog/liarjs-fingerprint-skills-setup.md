# LiarJS Skills - Setup Guide

**Source:** [liarjsdev/liarjs-skills](https://skills.sh/liarjsdev/liarjs-skills)
**GitHub:** [liarjsdev/liarjs-skills](https://github.com/liarjsdev/liarjs-skills)
**Skills:** 4 skills · 51.9K total installs
**Category:** Browser Automation & Anti-Detection
**First Seen:** August 15, 2026 sweep
**Quality Tier:** 🟢 Production

Four tightly-scoped skills around browser fingerprinting and Playwright stealth, each at 13.0K installs. Together they form a complete loop: audit a fingerprint (browser-fingerprint-audit), verify Playwright stealth posture (playwright-stealth-verify), gate CI on fingerprint health (fingerprint-ci-gate), and triage failures when detection regresses (fingerprint-failure-triage). Directly relevant to any agent that drives browsers against Cloudflare-protected or anti-bot sites.

## Installation

```bash
npx skills add liarjsdev/liarjs-skills
```

Individual skills:

```bash
npx skills add liarjsdev/liarjs-skills --skill playwright-stealth-verify
npx skills add liarjsdev/liarjs-skills --skill browser-fingerprint-audit
```

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Details |
|---|---|
| **Node.js + npx** | For the installer |
| **Playwright** | For stealth verification workflows |
| **CI pipeline** | For the fingerprint CI gate |

## What It Provides

| Skill | Installs | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| fingerprint-ci-gate | 13.0K | Gate CI runs on fingerprint health |
| playwright-stealth-verify | 13.0K | Verify Playwright stealth posture |
| browser-fingerprint-audit | 13.0K | Audit browser fingerprint signals |
| fingerprint-failure-triage | 13.0K | Triage detection regressions |

## Quick Start

1. `npx skills add liarjsdev/liarjs-skills`
2. Run the audit: "audit my Playwright browser context's fingerprint and flag detectable signals"
3. Wire the CI gate into the automation repo so stealth regressions fail the pipeline

## CorpusIQ Use Cases

| Use Case | How |
|---|---|
| **Mac Mini Playwright stack** | Stealth verification for the persistent-context browser used on Cloudflare-protected sites |
| **Anti-bot evasion QA** | Fingerprint audits before each platform-automation rollout |
| **Regression triage** | fingerprint-failure-triage when a platform starts blocking our automation |
| **CI hygiene** | Gate automation repos on fingerprint health before deploy |

## Limitations / Verification

- Stealth techniques evolve against detection - re-audit after platform updates
- Skills assume a Playwright/CI toolchain is already present

```bash
npx skills add liarjsdev/liarjs-skills --skill browser-fingerprint-audit   # verify install works
```
