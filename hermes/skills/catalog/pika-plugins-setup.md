# Pika Plugins - Setup Guide

**Source:** [pika-labs/pika-plugins](https://www.skills.sh/pika-labs/pika-plugins) (22 skills · 20.1K combined installs)
**Repo:** [github.com/pika-labs/pika-plugins](https://github.com/pika-labs/pika-plugins)
**Category:** AI Media / Marketing Video
**First Seen:** August 13, 2026
**Quality Tier:** 🟢 Production core (`ugc-ads`, `build-a-brand`, `founder-product-video`, `app-sizzle` at 1.5K each)

Pika's official plugin pack turns a video model into a marketing production line. The business-relevant half covers UGC ads, brand building, founder product videos, app sizzle reels, app store screens, explainers, and podcast clips. The creative half covers hooks, personas, content direction, and the VFX family. For an agent that already has a video backend, these skills are the creative direction layer that decides what to generate and why.

- Sports/entertainment skills are niche - skip unless that content vertical matters
- Verify install: `npx skills list | grep pika`
