## Key Capabilities

### Auth Architecture (best-practices)
Session management, JWT vs opaque tokens, OAuth 2.0/OIDC flows, social login patterns, and refresh token rotation.

### Auth Scaffolding (create-auth-skill)
Generate complete auth systems: database schema, API routes, middleware, email templates, and client SDK setup - all from a requirements prompt.

### Credential Management (email-and-password)
Password hashing (bcrypt/argon2), secure reset flows with time-limited tokens, brute-force detection with progressive delays, and email verification patterns.

### Multi-Tenancy (organization)
Organization/workspace creation, role-based access control (RBAC), team member invitations, domain-based auto-joining, and cross-org access patterns.

### Two-Factor (2FA)
TOTP setup with QR codes, SMS fallback, WebAuthn/passkeys, backup recovery codes, and 2FA enforcement policies.

### Security Hardening (security)
CSRF protection, CORS configuration, rate limiting, session hijacking detection, security audit logging, and GDPR-compliant data handling.
