## CorpusIQ Use Cases

| Use Case | Harness | Value |
|---|---|---|
| Automated video production | `cli-anything-shotcut` | Agent-driven video editing without manual GUI interaction |
| AI image generation at scale | `cli-anything-comfyui` | Batch Stable Diffusion workflows controlled by agents |
| Podcast/audio content | `cli-anything-notebooklm`, `cli-anything-audacity` | Generate and edit audio content programmatically |
| Research & citations | `cli-anything-zotero` | Automated reference gathering for content creation |
| Local AI infrastructure | `cli-anything-ollama` | Manage local models without leaving the agent workflow |
| 3D asset creation | `cli-anything-freecad` | Agent-driven CAD modeling for product visualization |

---

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Fix |
|---|---|
| `cli-anything` command not found | Install the CLI-Anything package globally: `pip install cli-anything` |
| Target app not launching | Each harness requires the specific GUI app installed - check the app's website |
| FreeCAD errors on headless | FreeCAD requires a display - use `xvfb-run` on headless Linux |
| ComfyUI workflow fails | Ensure ComfyUI server is running on the expected port (default: 8188) |
