## Installation

```bash
npx skills add ljagiello/ctf-skills
```

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Details |
|---|---|
| **Node.js + npx** | For the skill installer |
| **Security toolchain** | Ghidra, GDB, Burp Suite, and similar for the respective skills |
| **Authorization** | Explicit permission for any target you test against |

## What It Provides

| Skill | Installs | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| ctf-reverse | 7.4K | Binary and code reverse engineering |
| ctf-web | 7.1K | Web application exploitation |
| ctf-pwn | 6.9K | Binary exploitation |
| ctf-osint | 6.7K | Open-source intelligence gathering |
| ctf-crypto | 6.7K | Cryptographic challenges |
| ctf-forensics | 6.6K | Digital forensics |
| solve-challenge | 6.5K | End-to-end challenge solving |
| ctf-misc | 6.4K | Miscellaneous challenge techniques |
| ctf-malware | 6.3K | Malware analysis |
| ctf-writeup | 5.5K | Writeup and documentation generation |
| ctf-ai-ml | 5.4K | AI/ML security challenges |
| find-skills | 7 | Skill discovery helper |

## Quick Start

1. Install: `npx skills add ljagiello/ctf-skills`
2. Start with `solve-challenge` for the general workflow, then load category-specific skills
3. Ask: "analyze this binary and produce a writeup of the vulnerability"

## CorpusIQ Use Cases

| Use Case | How |
|---|---|
| **Security posture work** | ctf-web and ctf-reverse as structured checklists for our own penetration passes |
| **OSINT workflows** | ctf-osint as a methodology reference for competitive and market research |
| **Security content** | Writeup patterns for security-focused documentation |
| **Agent capability** | A reference for what an agent can do in a security analyst role |

## Limitations / Verification

- Publisher-page install counts verified; individual skill audit pages were not fetched for this multi-skill suite
- Offensive techniques - only use against systems you own or are explicitly authorized to test
- Skills assume CTF-style targets; adapting to production systems requires additional judgment

```bash
npx skills add ljagiello/ctf-skills   # verify install works
```
