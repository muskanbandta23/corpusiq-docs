**Quality Tier:** 🟢 Production (Gen Agent Trust Hub Pass / Socket Pass / Snyk Pass)

The largest design-focused skill collection on skills.sh: 107 agentic skills, commands, and plugins covering the full design lifecycle - research (user-persona, journey-map, competitive-analysis), systems (design tokens, color/typography/spacing systems, theming), specification (wireframe-spec, component-spec, micro-interaction-spec), evaluation (heuristic-evaluation, accessibility-audit, design-qa-checklist), and presentation (presentation-deck with stakeholder-update, design-review, and showcase structures). Includes a psychology layer (Gestalt laws, Jakob's Law, Tesler's Law, peak-end rule) for judgment calls.

## Prerequisites

- None - prompt-skill collection; no API keys or design-tool licenses
- Pairs with any frontend stack; token skills output framework-agnostic JSON/YAML

## CorpusIQ Use Cases

- **Brand visual systems** - token/color/typography skills supply the systematic layer for CorpusIQ's branded assets (ad images, dashboards, docs)
- **Product UX evaluation** - heuristic-evaluation and accessibility-audit skills are ready-made QA passes for CorpusIQ's product surface
- **Operator-facing decks** - presentation-deck's stakeholder-update structure is directly reusable for weekly operator/investor updates

## Limitations / Verification

- 107 skills is a lot of surface; install flagship skills (presentation-deck, design-token, accessibility-audit) rather than the full set
- Design judgment skills don't generate pixels - they structure agent reasoning; pair with image/UI tooling
- Verify install: `npx skills list | grep -E "presentation-deck|design-token"`

## Security
