## Installation

```bash
npx skills add rivet-dev/skills
```

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Details |
|---|---|
| **Node.js + npx** | For the skill installer |
| **Rivet account** | For deployment targets (rivet.gg) |
| **SDK runtime** | JavaScript, React, Swift, or Rust depending on the client skill |

## What It Provides

| Skill | Installs | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| sandbox-agent | 10.1K | Sandboxed agent execution environment |
| rivetkit | 7.7K | Core RivetKit toolkit |
| rivetkit-client-javascript | 7.6K | JS SDK client guide |
| rivetkit-client-react | 7.5K | React SDK client guide |
| rivetkit-client-swiftui / -swift | 7.3K each | SwiftUI and Swift client guides |
| multiplayer-game | 7.2K | Multiplayer game architecture |
| cron-jobs | 1.2K | Scheduled jobs on Rivet |
| ai-agent / ai-agent-workspace | 1.2K each | Agent deployment patterns |
| chat-room | 1.2K | Realtime chat reference |
| per-tenant-database | 1.1K | Tenant-isolated data layout |
| collaborative-text-editor / live-cursors | 1.1K each | CRDT-style collaboration references |
| vpc-air-gapped | 1.1K | Air-gapped VPC deployment |
| rivet-actors / rivet-agentos / rivet-workflows | 86 / 85 / 84 | Actor runtime, agent OS, and workflow concepts |

## Quick Start

1. Install: `npx skills add rivet-dev/skills`
2. Load sandbox-agent for agent execution or rivetkit for SDK work
3. Ask: "scaffold a sandboxed AI agent workspace on Rivet"

## CorpusIQ Use Cases

| Use Case | How |
|---|---|
| **Agent sandboxing** | sandbox-agent as a reference for isolated agent execution |
| **Realtime product features** | Multiplayer, chat, and live-cursor patterns for client builds |
| **Cron and agent infrastructure** | cron-jobs and ai-agent-workspace patterns map to our fleet scheduling |
| **Architecture reference** | Actor-model backend patterns from a proven vendor |

## Limitations / Verification

- Multi-skill suite; individual security-audit pages not fetched this sweep
- Requires a Rivet account for deployment skills; conceptual skills are readable standalone
- Long-tail skills (rivetkit-actors at 6 installs) are new and minimally validated

```bash
npx skills add rivet-dev/skills   # verify install works
```
