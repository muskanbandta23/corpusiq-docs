# Claude Code Skills - Setup Guide

**Quality Tier:** 🟢 Production

Claude Code is Anthropic's agentic coding tool that lives in your terminal. It understands your codebase, executes multi-step development tasks, and can be extended with custom skills, plugins, and hooks. These skills help Hermes agents build, develop, and customize their own Claude Code extensions - from creating new skills to writing hook rules and managing plugin structures.

## Installation

```bash
# Core skill development
npx skills add anthropics/claude-code --skill agent-development
npx skills add anthropics/claude-code --skill skill-development

# Plugin + hook authoring
npx skills add anthropics/claude-code --skill plugin-structure
npx skills add anthropics/claude-code --skill plugin-settings
npx skills add anthropics/claude-code --skill writing-hookify-rules

# Model migration
npx skills add anthropics/claude-code --skill claude-opus-4-5-migration
```

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Details |
|---|---|
| **Claude Code CLI** | `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code` (or `npx @anthropic-ai/claude-code`) |
| **Anthropic API key** | Required for Claude Code agent usage |
| **Node.js 18+** | Required for Claude Code runtime |

## Key Capabilities

### Agent Development
Build production coding agents that understand your codebase, execute multi-file changes, run tests, and integrate with git workflows. Includes system prompt engineering, tool authorization patterns, and agent lifecycle management.

### Skill Development
Create reusable skills with YAML frontmatter (`name`, `description`, `trigger`) and markdown instructions. Skills are Claude Code's extension mechanism - they teach the agent domain-specific workflows, conventions, and tool patterns.

### Plugin Authoring
Structure plugins with manifests, hook registrations, and settings schemas. Plugins extend Claude Code with custom commands, MCP server integrations, and project-specific automation.

### Hookify Rules
Define code transformation rules that Claude Code applies during code generation and refactoring sessions. Supports pattern matching, AST-aware transformations, and project-specific linting.

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Install Claude Code (if not already)
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code

# 2. Add the agent-development skill
npx skills add anthropics/claude-code --skill agent-development

# 3. Use the skill in Claude Code
claude "Using the agent-development skill, help me build a code review agent"

# 4. Create your first custom skill
npx skills add anthropics/claude-code --skill skill-development
claude "Using the skill-development skill, create a new skill for running pytest suites"
```

---

## Verification

```bash
# Check installed Claude Code skills
npx skills list | grep anthropics/claude-code

# Verify Claude Code can see the skills
claude --version
claude "list available skills" | grep -i claude-code
```

## Notes

- Claude Code is distinct from the `anthropics/skills` catalog (700K+ installs for frontend-design, skill-creator, etc.) - that repo focuses on general-purpose agent skills rather than Claude Code extensibility
- These skills are most valuable when building custom Hermes sub-agents that use Claude Code for implementation
- Plugin skills work with Claude Code's hooks system (Starter, PostToolUse, Stop, etc.)
- For Hermes agents: use `agent-development` and `skill-development` to extend your coding capabilities without leaving the terminal
