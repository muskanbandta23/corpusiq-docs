# Stably Orca - Setup Guide

**Source:** [stablyai/orca](https://www.skills.sh/stablyai/orca) (317.5K combined installs)
**GitHub:** [github.com/stablyai/orca](https://github.com/stablyai/orca)
**Category:** Agent Orchestration / CLI
**First Seen:** August 12, 2026
**Quality Tier:** 🟡 Beta (strong core skills, long tail still forming)

Orca is Stably AI's agent orchestration layer. `orca-cli` (125K installs) is the command-line driver; `orchestration` (104.2K) defines multi-agent workflow patterns; `computer-use` (77.3K) adds desktop control. A growing tail covers Linear ticket automation, Android/iOS emulator control, and autonomous PR loops (auto-review-fix, auto-pr-merge).

---

## Installation

```bash
# Install the full repo
npx skills add stablyai/orca

# Or install the core individually
npx skills add stablyai/orca --skill orca-cli
npx skills add stablyai/orca --skill orchestration
npx skills add stablyai/orca --skill computer-use
```

| `computer-use` | 77.3K | Desktop/UI control |

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Details |
|---|---|
| Node.js + npx | For the skills.sh CLI install path |
| Orca runtime | Check the repo README for the CLI install (`orca-cli` drives it) |
| Linear API key | For `orca-linear` / `linear-tickets` |

---

## CorpusIQ Use Cases

| Use Case | How |
|---|---|
| **Orchestration reference** | `orchestration` patterns to cross-check the multi-agent workflows in the growth stack |
| **Linear-based ops** | `orca-linear` + `linear-tickets` when Linear becomes the ops tracking layer |
| **Autonomous PR loops** | `auto-review-fix` pattern for docs repo automation (once the tail matures) |

---

## Limitations / Verification

- Long tail (7 of 15 skills) is single-digit installs - production-ready core, experimental periphery
- Verify install: `npx skills list | grep orca`
