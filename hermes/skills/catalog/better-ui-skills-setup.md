# Better UI Skills - Setup Guide

**Source:** [jakubkrehel/skills](https://skills.sh/jakubkrehel/skills)
**GitHub:** [jakubkrehel/skills](https://github.com/jakubkrehel/skills)
**Skills:** 13 skills · 51.3K total installs
**Category:** UI Design & Interface Polish
**First Seen:** August 14, 2026 evening sweep
**Quality Tier:** 🟡 Beta (community suite, hot on the leaderboard)

The Better UI suite encodes interface-polish discipline: better-ui (8.6K installs), better-typography (8.3K), better-colors (8.0K), better-interface (6.2K), better-layout (6.2K), better-accessibility (6.1K), and better-writing (6.1K), plus interface-review (1.6K) and OKLCH-based color skills. All six core skills were rising on the hot leaderboard during the sweep hour (+6 to +11 installs each). The suite is a focused alternative to heavyweight design systems - take an existing UI and make it genuinely better across type, color, layout, accessibility, and copy.

## Quick Start

1. `npx skills add jakubkrehel/skills`
2. "Run better-typography on the docs.corpusiq.io landing page styles"
3. "Apply better-accessibility to the signup flow"
4. "Do an interface-review of the dashboard and list the top 10 fixes"

## CorpusIQ Use Cases

| Use Case | How |
|---|---|
| **Docs site polish** | better-typography and better-colors on MkDocs theme overrides |
| **Frontend QA** | interface-review as a pre-deploy design pass on www.corpusiq.io |
| **Accessibility compliance** | better-accessibility for WCAG passes on public pages |
| **Marketing page copy** | better-writing for landing page microcopy |

## Limitations / Verification

- Guidance-oriented: the skills direct the agent's design judgment rather than generating assets
- Community-maintained; results vary by agent model - always review diffs before merge

```bash
npx skills list | grep -i better
```
