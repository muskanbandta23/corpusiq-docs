### Swarm Mode (Multi-Agent)
Persistent tmux-backed agent workers with role-based dispatch:
- `builder`: Code implementation
- `reviewer`: PR review and validation
- `docs`: Documentation
- `research`: Investigation
- `ops`: Operations and deployment
- `triage`: Issue classification
- `qa`: Quality assurance
- `lab`: Experiments

### Conductor Mission Dispatch
Mission decomposition and dispatch with fallback to native swarm orchestration. Supports auto-decomposition mode and Kanban task board.

### PWA Support
Install as native app, access over Tailscale. Works on mobile devices.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start gateway
hermes gateway run

# Terminal 2: Start dashboard (optional)
hermes dashboard

# Terminal 3: Start workspace
cd ~/hermes-workspace && pnpm dev

# Access at http://localhost:3000
```

### Swarm Mode

```bash
cd ~/hermes-workspace
pnpm swarm:start
# Configure roles in UI: Settings → Swarm → Configure Roles
```

### Remote Access via Tailscale

```bash
echo 'HERMES_API_URL=http://100.x.y.z:8642' >> .env
# Gateway must bind to 0.0.0.0
echo 'API_SERVER_HOST=0.0.0.0' >> ~/.hermes/.env
```

---

## Verification

```bash
# Verify gateway
curl http://127.0.0.1:8642/health

# Verify workspace
curl http://localhost:3000

# Check swarm workers
pnpm swarm:status

# Check connection in Settings → Connection → Test Connection
```

---

## Notes

- Supports local models (Ollama, LM Studio, Atomic Chat) by pointing `HERMES_API_URL` to their endpoints
- Multi-container Docker setup available for production with gateway, dashboard, and workspace orchestration
- Custom themes configurable in `src/styles/themes/` with full color/font customization
- Workspace caches build artifacts - clear `.next` and rebuild if memory issues occur
- Swarm workers use tmux sessions - check `tmux ls` to verify worker processes
