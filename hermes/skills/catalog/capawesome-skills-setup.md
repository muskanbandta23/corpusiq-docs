Capawesome is a well-known Capacitor and Ionic ecosystem team (plugin vendor, capawesome.cloud services, Capawesome CLI). This is their agent skill suite for mobile app work: installing and configuring Capacitor plugins from official, Capawesome, community, Firebase, MLKit, and RevenueCat sources; app development across Ionic (Angular, React, Vue) and Capacitor (Angular, React, Vue); plugin development and SPM support; in-app purchases and push notifications; and migrations between Capawesome Cloud and Capgo. The flagship capacitor-plugins skill encodes careful agent behavior: step-by-step guidance, auto-detection of project state before asking questions, one decision at a time, and concrete options instead of open-ended prompts.

## Limitations / Verification

- Security audits on the capacitor-plugins flagship: Gen Agent Trust Hub Pass, Socket Pass, Snyk Fail (named in the tier)
- Publisher-page total verified (11.4K across 37 skills); 38 GitHub stars as of the sweep
- Below the 20K install guide bar - drafted on ecosystem-team authority (Capawesome is the recognized Capacitor plugin vendor) and direct relevance to agent-built mobile apps
- Skills assume an existing Capacitor project and macOS/iOS tooling for native work

```bash
npx skills add capawesome-team/skills   # verify install works
```
