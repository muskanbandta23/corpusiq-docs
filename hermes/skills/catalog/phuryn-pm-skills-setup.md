```bash
# Run competitive analysis
npx skills use phuryn/pm-skills@competitor-analysis
# Then: "Analyze the competitive landscape for AI-powered data analytics tools targeting mid-market companies"
```

The skill produces a 5-competitor structured report with:
- Market overview and definition
- Individual competitor profiles (strengths, weaknesses, pricing, threats)
- Differentiation opportunities with specific actionable gaps
- Strategic synthesis and recommendations

## Notes

- Competitive analysis is the most polished skill - structured, thorough, and actionable
- 5-competitor format is ideal for board decks, investor updates, and strategic planning
- Business model skill uses standard Business Model Canvas framework
- Privacy policy skill useful for compliance documentation but verify output against legal requirements
- Complements `deanpeters/product-manager-skills` (PRDs, user stories) and `refoundai/lenny-skills` (PM methodology)
- Directly useful for CorpusIQ competitive intelligence and market positioning work
