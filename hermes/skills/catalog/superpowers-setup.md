# Superpowers - Setup Guide

**Source:** [obra/superpowers](https://skills.sh/obra/superpowers) (1.2M+ combined installs)
**GitHub:** [obra/superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) (261K+ ⭐)
**Category:** Agent Infrastructure / Development Methodology
**Quality Tier:** 🟢 Production

Superpowers is the most widely adopted agentic skills framework - a battle-tested development methodology that turns AI coding agents into systematic, reliable engineering partners. With 1.2M+ combined installs across 15+ skills, it covers the full software development lifecycle: brainstorming, planning, test-driven development, systematic debugging, code review, and more. For Hermes agents, Superpowers provides proven workflows that eliminate guesswork and enforce engineering rigor.

|---|---|---|
| **brainstorming** | 294.5K | Structured ideation - explore solutions, evaluate trade-offs, converge on architecture |
| **systematic-debugging** | 199.6K | Root-cause analysis methodology - reproduce, isolate, fix, verify |

## Key Capabilities

### Brainstorming (294.5K installs)
The most-installed agent skill on skills.sh. Guides agents through structured exploration: define the problem, generate candidate solutions, evaluate trade-offs (performance, complexity, maintainability), and converge on an architecture decision. Replaces vague "what should I do?" agent loops with a decision framework.

### Systematic Debugging (199.6K installs)
Eliminates debugging guesswork. Five-phase methodology: (1) reproduce the bug with minimal input, (2) isolate the failure to specific code paths, (3) root-cause analysis using git bisect or log tracing, (4) implement the fix, (5) verify with regression tests. Reduces debugging time by forcing methodological rigor instead of random print statements.

### Test-Driven Development (177.1K installs)
True TDD workflow for AI agents: write failing test → implement minimum code to pass → refactor. Prevents over-engineering by enforcing "simplest thing that works" at each step. Includes patterns for mocking, fixtures, and test organization.

### Writing Plans (196.8K installs)
Implementation planning that produces actionable steps - not vague descriptions. Each plan step includes: what to change, which files, what tests verify it, expected diff size. Allows agents to execute complex features without losing context mid-implementation.

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Install the framework
npx skills add obra/superpowers --skill using-superpowers
npx skills add obra/superpowers --skill brainstorming

# 2. Start with a brainstorming session
claude "Using the brainstorming skill, explore architectures for a real-time collaboration feature"

# 3. Convert the decision into an implementation plan
npx skills add obra/superpowers --skill writing-plans
claude "Using the writing-plans skill, create an implementation plan from the brainstorming output"

# 4. Execute with TDD
npx skills add obra/superpowers --skill test-driven-development
claude "Using the TDD skill, implement step 1 of the plan"
```

---

## Verification

```bash
# Check installed Superpowers
npx skills list | grep obra/superpowers

# Verify the framework loads
npx skills use obra/superpowers@using-superpowers
```

## Notes

- Superpowers is framework-agnostic - works with Claude Code, Codex, and any skills.sh-compatible agent
- The `brainstorming` skill alone has more installs than many entire skill catalogs - it's the de facto standard for agent ideation
- Combine with `anthropics/claude-code` skills for the full agent development toolkit: Superpowers for methodology + Claude Code skills for extensibility
- For Hermes agents: use `systematic-debugging` and `writing-plans` before any implementation work - they enforce the rigor that prevents context-window sprawl
- The `using-superpowers` skill teaches the agent how to chain skills together (brainstorm → plan → TDD → review) for end-to-end feature delivery
