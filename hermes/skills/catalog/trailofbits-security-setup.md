## CorpusIQ Use Cases

| Use Case | How |
|---|---|
| **Agent skill security audit** | Use `static-analysis` + `semgrep-rule-creator` to audit CorpusIQ agent skills |
| **Supply chain hardening** | Run `supply-chain-risk-auditor` on corpusiq-docs dependencies |
| **GitHub Actions security** | Use `agentic-actions-auditor` to audit CI/CD workflows |
| **Code maturity tracking** | Run `code-maturity-assessor` quarterly on core repos |
| **Secure workflow enforcement** | Use `secure-workflow-guide` as pre-commit gate |

---

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Fix |
|---|---|
| **Plugin marketplace not found** | Upgrade Claude Code: `npm update -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code` |
| **SARIF parsing fails** | Verify SARIF v2.1.0 format - older versions not supported |
| **CodeQL database missing** | Run `codeql database create` before analysis |
| **Semgrep rules not triggering** | Check rule language matches target - use `semgrep-rule-variant-creator` to port |

## Verification

```bash
# List installed plugins
/plugin list | grep trailofbits

# Run a quick security scan
# In agent: "Run static-analysis on the current repo"

# Test semgrep
semgrep --config auto .
```
