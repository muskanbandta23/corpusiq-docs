## Notes

- **341 total skills** - the largest single-publisher collection on skills.sh. Install selectively by category rather than the full set
- **MIT licensed** - safe for commercial use and modification
- **Compatible agents**: Claude Code, Codex CLI, Hermes Agent, OpenClaw, Cursor, Gemini CLI
- The engineering tier (37 skills) is particularly strong for Hermes agents building MCP servers, RAG pipelines, and observability systems
- Marketing skills complement existing CorpusIQ catalog entries for copywriting, SEO, and content strategy
- Some skills have YAML frontmatter parse warnings on install - cosmetic only, skills function correctly
- The loop-library skill is uniquely suited for Hermes agent automation - it formalizes the trigger → action → verify → stop pattern that Hermes natively supports
