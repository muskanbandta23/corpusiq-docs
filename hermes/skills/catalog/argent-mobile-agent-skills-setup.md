## Quick Start

1. Install: `npx skills add software-mansion/argent`
2. Start with the emulator or simulator setup skill for your target platform
3. Ask: "set up an Android emulator and run my React Native app through the canonical workflow"

## CorpusIQ Use Cases

| Use Case | How |
|---|---|
| **Mobile QA automation** | Emulator/simulator setup plus screenshot diffing replaces manual device checks |
| **RN performance work** | Profiler skills for client mobile projects |
| **Agent-driven device testing** | device-interact and test-ui-flow as a mobile testing surface |
| **Reference architecture** | Vendor-quality skill packaging from a top React Native shop |

## Limitations / Verification

- Publisher-page install counts verified; individual skill audit pages were not fetched for this multi-skill suite
- iOS simulator skills require macOS with Xcode; Android skills require the SDK
- Three simulator skills (argent-ios-profiler, argent-simulator-setup, argent-simulator-interact) show single-digit installs and should be treated as new

```bash
npx skills add software-mansion/argent   # verify install works
```
