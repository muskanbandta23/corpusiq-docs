## Tips

- Hooks determine 80% of engagement - spend 50% of creation time on the first line
- Carousels and document posts outperform text-only on LinkedIn by 3-5x
- Reply to relevant conversations before posting - engagement earns reach
- One strong take per post - multiple ideas dilute the message
- Video content: first 3 seconds determine whether they keep watching

---

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|---|---|
| Low engagement | Audit hooks - are they specific, emotional, or counterintuitive? |
| Zero reach | Check for shadowbans, platform restrictions, or algorithm changes |
| Content fatigue | Repurpose top performers in new formats instead of creating from scratch |
| Inconsistent posting | Build a 2-week content buffer before starting daily posting |
