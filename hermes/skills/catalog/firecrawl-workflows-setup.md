### Integration Pattern

All workflows can be chained into automated research pipelines:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Weekly competitive intelligence pipeline
# Save to: ~/.hermes/profiles/corpusiq/cron/weekly-competitive-intel.sh

WEEK=$(date +%Y-W%V)
OUTDIR=~/corpusiq-brain/research/$WEEK
mkdir -p $OUTDIR

# 1. Market landscape
firecrawl-market-research \
    --company "CorpusIQ" \
    --competitors "Glean, Notion AI, Mem, Tana, Coda AI" \
    > $OUTDIR/market-landscape.md

# 2. Deep dive on top competitor
firecrawl-deep-research \
    "Glean AI enterprise search features pricing 2026" \
    --depth 3 --sources 15 \
    > $OUTDIR/glean-deep-dive.md

# 3. SEO gap analysis
firecrawl-seo-audit https://corpusiq.io \
    --competitors "glean.com" \
    > $OUTDIR/seo-gap-analysis.md

# 4. Import to GBrain for semantic search
cd ~/corpusiq-brain && gbrain import research/$WEEK/ --no-embed
```

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY not set` | Missing API key | Sign up at firecrawl.dev, export key |
| Rate limited (429) | Free tier limits | Upgrade or add delays between calls |
| Empty lead results | Too restrictive filters | Broaden `--industry` or remove `--domains` |
| Research too shallow | Low `--depth` | Increase to 3-4 for comprehensive coverage |
| SEO audit timeout | Large site | Add `--pages 100` to limit crawl scope |
