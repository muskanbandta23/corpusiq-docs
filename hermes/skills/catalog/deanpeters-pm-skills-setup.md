## Key Capabilities

### PRD Development
- **Standard Template**: Executive summary → problem statement → personas → strategic context → solution → metrics → user stories → out of scope
- **Input Flexibility**: Works with full discovery notes OR starts from problem definition alone
- **Evidence-Driven**: Customer quotes, data, research, competitive landscape
- **OKR Alignment**: Ladders features to business goals
- **Scope Discipline**: Explicit "what are we NOT building" section

### User Story Creation
- **Standard Format**: "As a [persona], I want [action] so that [outcome]"
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Given-When-Then format for testable requirements
- **Story Mapping**: Organize stories into epics, themes, and releases
- **Priority Framework**: MoSCoW or RICE scoring integration

### Roadmap Planning
- **Timeline Visualization**: Now / Next / Later structure
- **Milestone Tracking**: Key deliverables with dates and dependencies
- **Resource Planning**: Team allocation, skill requirements, capacity
- **Risk Management**: Dependencies, blockers, mitigation strategies

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# Generate a PRD from problem statement
npx skills use deanpeters/product-manager-skills@prd-development
# Then: "Build a PRD for self-serve workspace provisioning - here are my discovery notes"

# Generate user stories from PRD
npx skills use deanpeters/product-manager-skills@user-story
# Then: "Create user stories for the workspace provisioning feature"
```

---

## Verification

```bash
npx skills list | grep deanpeters/product-manager-skills
```

---

## Notes

- Structured, template-driven approach - consistent output format every time
- Works with or without upfront discovery data; handles "empty-handed" invocations gracefully
- Complements `phuryn/pm-skills` (competitive analysis) and `refoundai/lenny-skills` (PM methodology)
- PRD template follows industry-standard sections used at major tech companies
- Useful for CorpusIQ product development workflow and feature specification
