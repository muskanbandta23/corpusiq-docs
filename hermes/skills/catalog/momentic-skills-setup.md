Momentic is an AI-native QA platform, and this is its official skill pack. Agents write and run end-to-end tests, classify failures, test mobile flows, and turn specs into test plans. The strongest agent-first QA cluster on skills.sh - relevant for any team shipping agent-built software without a dedicated QA function.

## Installation

```bash
npx skills add momentic-ai/skills
```

## Core Skills

| Skill | Installs | Use For |
|---|---|---|
| momentic-test | 41.0K | Authoring and running E2E tests |
| momentic-result-classification | 41.0K | Classifying test failures (bug vs flake vs env) |
| momentic-mobile-test | 26.8K | Mobile app test flows |
| momentic-explore-prompt | 9.3K | Exploratory testing prompts |
| momentic-spec | 786 | Spec-to-test plan generation |

## Prerequisites

- Momentic account (free tier for small teams)
- A deployed app or live site under test

## CorpusIQ Use Cases

- **QA gate for agent-built features** - run `momentic-test` against internal tools and docs site changes before shipping
- **Flake triage** - `momentic-result-classification` cuts noise from CI pipelines (the flake-vs-real-bug split is the expensive part of agent-driven QA)
- **Spec-driven acceptance** - `momentic-spec` converts product specs into acceptance tests for customer deliverables

## Limitations / Verification

- Tests execute on Momentic's platform - no fully local mode
- Verify: author one smoke test against docs.corpusiq.io and confirm it passes on the Momentic dashboard
