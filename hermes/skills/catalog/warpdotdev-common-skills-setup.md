# Warp Common Skills - Setup Guide

**Source:** [warpdotdev/common-skills](https://www.skills.sh/warpdotdev/common-skills) (411.2K combined installs)
**GitHub:** [github.com/warpdotdev/common-skills](https://github.com/warpdotdev/common-skills)
**Category:** Development Workflow / Spec-Driven Development
**First Seen:** August 12, 2026
**Quality Tier:** 🟢 Production (Warp team, uniform ~20K installs per skill)

Warp (the terminal company) publishes the skills their own agents use daily. The cluster centers on spec-driven development: write product and tech specs, implement against them, then verify the implementation matches the spec. Around that core sit PR mechanics (`review-pr`, `create-pr`, `pr-walkthrough`), failure handling (`fix-errors`, `diagnose-ci-failures`, `reproduce-bug-report`), and meta-workflows (`council`, `saga`, `research`).

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Details |
|---|---|
| Node.js + npx | For the skills.sh CLI install path |
| Git + GitHub workflow | PR-centric skills assume GitHub |
| Agent runtime | Hermes/Claude Code-style agent with shell access |

---

## CorpusIQ Use Cases

| Use Case | How |
|---|---|
| **Docs & repo quality** | `review-pr` + `check-impl-against-spec` on every agent-driven commit |
| **Feature planning** | `write-product-spec` before agent build tasks |
| **CI health** | `diagnose-ci-failures` for the docs build and MCP server pipelines |
| **Long-running sweeps** | `saga` to orchestrate multi-step cron workflows |

---

## Limitations / Verification

- GitHub-centric - non-GitHub forges get partial coverage
- Verify install: `npx skills list | grep -E "review-pr|spec"`
