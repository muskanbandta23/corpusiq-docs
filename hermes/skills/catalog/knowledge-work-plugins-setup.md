## Key Capabilities

### Core Productivity

**Data Visualization:** Transform raw datasets into publication-ready charts: line, bar, scatter, heatmap, Sankey, and geospatial. Supports Matplotlib, D3.js, Vega-Lite, and Observable Plot. Auto-detects chart type based on data structure and analysis goal.

**Technical Documentation:** Write and maintain technical documentation: API references with OpenAPI, architecture decision records (ADRs), onboarding guides, and changelogs. Enforces consistent voice and structure.

**Code Review:** Anthropic own code review methodology - focuses on knowledge transfer: explains why patterns work, suggests improvements with rationale, and links to relevant documentation.

**Dashboard Building:** Build operational dashboards: KPIs, trend lines, alert thresholds, and drill-down capabilities. Supports React/Vue components or standalone HTML with real-time WebSocket data binding.

**Task Management:** Decompose large projects into manageable tasks, estimate complexity, identify dependencies, and track progress. Compatible with Linear, Jira, GitHub Projects, and plain Markdown.

**Memory Management:** Strategies for agent memory systems: classification of what to persist (user preferences, project context, learned patterns), retrieval triggers, staleness detection, and compaction policies.

### 🆕 Communication & Content

**Content Creation:** Multi-channel content templates with platform-specific best practices:
- **Blog posts:** Hook → body → CTA structure, SEO optimization
- **Emails:** Subject lines under 50 chars, preview text, scannable body sections, one CTA per email
- **Landing pages:** Headline (under 10 words), subheadline, hero section, 3-4 value propositions
- **Social media:** Platform-specific formats with voice preservation

**Slack Messaging:** Compose professional Slack messages with correct mrkdwn formatting (`*bold*` not `**bold**`, `<url|text>` not `[text](url)`). Enforces message structure guidelines (lead with the point, keep it short, use line breaks), thread vs. channel etiquette, and tone appropriate to audience.

**Slack Search:** Advanced Slack search with:
- Natural language queries ("What is the deadline for project X?")
- Keyword search with channel/user/date modifiers (`in:#channel`, `from:@user`, `after:`, `before:`)
- Multi-pass strategy: search topic → search people → search specific channels
- Deduplication of results across multiple searches

### 🆕 Research & Synthesis

**Knowledge Synthesis:** Merge overlapping information from multiple sources (chat threads, emails, docs, project trackers) into unified narratives. Deduplicates by content similarity, author, timestamps, and cross-references. Produces single narrative items with full source attribution.

**Search Strategy:** Query decomposition framework - extracts keywords, entities, intent signals, constraints, and negations from user questions. Translates natural language queries into source-specific syntax (Slack modifiers, GitHub search, file system grep patterns). Ranks results by relevance and source authority.

### 🆕 Integration & Tooling

**Design MCP Workflow:** Structured workflow for MCP (Model Context Protocol) design - assesses fit for MCP integration, designs server architecture (resources, tools, prompts), and implements with proper error handling and authentication.

**Build Zoom REST API App:** End-to-end guide for building Zoom REST API applications - covers meetings, webinars, cloud recordings, dashboards/reports, and OAuth authentication flow.

**Scribe:** Media transcription routing guardrail - detects when uploaded or stored media needs transcription, routes to appropriate transcription tooling, and returns structured text output with timestamps.

## Notes

- Official Anthropic-maintained skills - highest quality tier, 🟢 Production
- Updated July 28, 2026: expanded from 6 skills (43K) to 14 skills (66K+) - 8 new skills discovered via skills.sh marketplace sweep
