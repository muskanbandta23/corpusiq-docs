| Requirement | Details |
|---|---|
| **Google Cloud account** | Required for deploy and observability skills |
| **Python 3.10+** | Core runtime |
| **gcloud CLI** | For deployment workflows |

## Key Capabilities

### Agent Development (adk-code)
Full Google ADK development patterns - tool definitions, memory management, multi-turn conversations, streaming responses, and safety filters.

### Agent Workflows (workflow)
Chain agents together, define conditional branching, parallel execution, and human-in-the-loop checkpoints.

### Agent Evaluation (eval)
Structured eval harness - test datasets, metric definitions, regression detection, and A/B comparison between agent versions.

### Scaffolding (scaffold)
`adk init` equivalent - project templates, directory structures, config files, and CI/CD pipeline generation.

### Deployment (deploy)
Push agents to Vertex AI Agent Builder, Cloud Run, or GKE. Environment variable management and canary rollout support.

### Observability
OpenTelemetry-based tracing for agent runs, latency breakdowns by step, token usage tracking, and error rate dashboards.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Scaffold a new agent project
npx skills use google/agents-cli@google-agents-cli-scaffold

# Build the agent logic
npx skills use google/agents-cli@google-agents-cli-adk-code

# Define multi-step workflows
npx skills use google/agents-cli@google-agents-cli-workflow

# Evaluate before deploying
npx skills use google/agents-cli@google-agents-cli-eval

# Deploy to Google Cloud
npx skills use google/agents-cli@google-agents-cli-deploy

# Monitor in production
npx skills use google/agents-cli@google-agents-cli-observability
```

---

## Verification

```bash
npx skills list | grep google-agents-cli
```

## Notes

- Official Google product - actively maintained, frequent updates
- All 6 skills have near-identical install counts (~59.5K), indicating they're typically installed as a bundle
- Requires Google Cloud for deploy/observability skills; code/eval/scaffold work standalone
- Complements Hermes agent infrastructure for production deployment patterns
- Quality tier 🟢 Production: 357K+ combined installs, Google-maintained
