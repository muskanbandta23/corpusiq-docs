# App Store Connect CLI Skills - Setup Guide

**Source:** [rorkai/app-store-connect-cli-skills](https://www.skills.sh/rorkai/app-store-connect-cli-skills) (33 skills · 53.5K combined installs)
**Repo:** [github.com/rorkai/app-store-connect-cli-skills](https://github.com/rorkai/app-store-connect-cli-skills)
**Category:** Platform Integration / Mobile DevOps
**First Seen:** August 13, 2026
**Quality Tier:** 🟢 Production (23 `asc-*` skills at 2.2K+ installs each)

The most complete agent-facing cluster for mobile release operations observed on skills.sh. Twenty-three App Store Connect skills cover the full release lifecycle - signing, builds, metadata, screenshots, TestFlight, submission health, crash triage, notarization, ASO, and Apple Ads - and ten `gpd-*` skills mirror the same flows for Google Play Developer. This is the skill set that lets an agent run an app release end to end without opening either console.
