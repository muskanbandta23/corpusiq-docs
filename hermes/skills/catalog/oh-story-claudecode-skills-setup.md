## Quick Start

## CorpusIQ Use Cases

| Use Case | How |
|---|---|
| **Content pipeline** | Long-write plus deslop matches our de-AI-fication doctrine for public content |
| **Browser automation** | browser-cdp as an alternative to our Playwright stack for page-level tasks |
| **Content scanning** | long-scan and short-scan as pre-publish QA passes |
| **Cover generation** | story-cover for post thumbnails and article heroes |

## Limitations / Verification

- Community-maintained; no security-audit pages fetched for this multi-skill suite
- Browser-cdp requires a Chrome/Chromium instance with remote debugging enabled
- Install counts verified on the publisher page; API sums undercount (11.4K vs 146.6K)

```bash
npx skills add worldwonderer/oh-story-claudecode   # verify install works
```
