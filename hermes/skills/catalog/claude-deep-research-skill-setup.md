The decision tree routes simple lookups to WebSearch and only complex analyses into the full pipeline - the right triage design for an autonomous agent.

## Installation

```bash
npx skills add https://github.com/199-biotechnologies/claude-deep-research-skill --skill deep-research
```

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Details |
|---|---|
| **Node.js + npx** | For the skill installer |
| **Web search access** | For source gathering |
| **Markdown-friendly output target** | Reports are markdown-first |

## What It Provides

| Skill | Installs | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| deep-research | 9.4K | Citation-tracked research reports with evidence persistence |

## Quick Start

1. Install: `npx skills add https://github.com/199-biotechnologies/claude-deep-research-skill --skill deep-research`
2. Ask: "research the MCP server landscape and produce a citation-tracked report"
3. Review the Introduction and Methodology sections - the skill surfaces high-materiality assumptions there explicitly

## CorpusIQ Use Cases

| Use Case | How |
|---|---|
| **Market research sweeps** | Citation-tracked output for competitive and market reports |
| **Funding research** | Structured, verifiable reports for investor diligence |
| **Docs content** | Evidence-backed drafts for the knowledge base |
| **Verification discipline** | Claim-level verification as a pattern for our own research quality |

## Limitations / Verification

- Security audits: Gen Agent Trust Hub Pass, Socket Pass, Snyk Warn (named in audit; manual review recommended)
- Single-skill package - the pipeline is opinionated and may not fit ad-hoc research
- Verification command: `npx skills add https://github.com/199-biotechnologies/claude-deep-research-skill --skill deep-research`
