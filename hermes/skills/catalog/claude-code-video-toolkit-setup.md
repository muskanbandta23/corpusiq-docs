## Quick Start

1. Install: `npx skills add digitalsamba/claude-code-video-toolkit`
2. Start with `ffmpeg` and `remotion` - the highest-install pair
3. Ask: "record this browser session, add an ElevenLabs voiceover, and render a Remotion composition"

## CorpusIQ Use Cases

| Use Case | How |
|---|---|
| **UGC video pipeline** | ffmpeg and remotion skills as reference patterns for our HyperFrames and Remotion stacks |
| **Voiceover production** | elevenlabs skill pairs with our existing TTS workflows |
| **Screen recordings** | playwright-recording for demo and tutorial content |
| **GPU rendering** | runpod skill for offloading renders from local hardware |

## Limitations / Verification

- Publisher-page install counts verified; individual skill audit pages were not fetched for this multi-skill suite
- Several skills (playwright-recording, elevenlabs, remotion) show under 1K installs - treat as newer, less-proven content
- Requires ffmpeg on PATH and paid API keys for ElevenLabs, RunPod, and generation services

```bash
npx skills add digitalsamba/claude-code-video-toolkit   # verify install works
```
