## Key Capabilities

### pdf - PDF Manipulation
- Render PDFs to PNGs for visual inspection (`pdftoppm`)
- Generate PDFs programmatically with `reportlab`
- Extract text with `pdfplumber` and `pypdf`
- Quality-first: verify alignment, spacing, and legibility before delivery
- Dependencies: poppler-utils, reportlab, pdfplumber, pypdf

### gh-fix-ci - CI Debugging
- Inspect failing PR checks via `gh pr checks`
- Fetch GitHub Actions logs for actionable failures
- Bundled `inspect_pr_checks.py` script handles API field drift
- Creates fix plans with approval gates before implementation
- Scope: GitHub Actions only (external providers like Buildkite are out of scope)

### security-best-practices - Security Auditing
- Auto-detects language and framework from project context
- Loads reference files for Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, and Go
- Three modes: secure-by-default coding, passive vulnerability detection, full security reports
- Produces prioritized reports with severity classifications
- Supports project-specific overrides with documentation

### linear - Project Management
- Manage Linear issues, cycles, and project tracking
- CLI-driven workflow for ticket creation and status updates

### playwright - Browser Testing
- End-to-end browser automation and testing
- Cross-browser testing with Playwright's API

### figma-implement-design - Design-to-Code
- Convert Figma design files into production-ready code
- Handles component extraction, styling, and layout implementation

## Quick Start

```bash
# PDF generation
npx skills use openai/skills@pdf

# Debug failing CI
npx skills use openai/skills@gh-fix-ci

# Security audit
npx skills use openai/skills@security-best-practices
```

---

## Verification

```bash
npx skills list | grep "openai/skills"
# Expected: 6 skills listed with install counts
```

---

## Notes

- These are official OpenAI skills - well-maintained and updated regularly
- All skills use `npx skills add` for installation (standard marketplace workflow)
- The `security-best-practices` skill is especially valuable for Hermes agents working on production codebases
- `gh-fix-ci` includes a bundled Python script for reliable CI inspection (works around `gh` CLI field drift)
- PDF skill prefers visual verification - renders to PNG before declaring output ready
