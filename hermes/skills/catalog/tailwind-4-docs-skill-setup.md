tailwind-4-docs teaches an agent to answer Tailwind CSS v4 questions - utilities, variants, config, migration, compatibility, implementation, refactors, and reviews - from a locally synced snapshot of the official documentation, instead of stale training data.

## Installation

```bash
npx skills add lombiq/tailwind-agent-skills --skill tailwind-4-docs
```

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Details |
|---|---|
| **Node.js + npx** | For the skill installer |
| **One-time snapshot init** | The skill requires initializing the docs snapshot into references/docs/ |

## What It Provides

| Capability | Notes |
|---|---|
| Local docs snapshot | references/docs/ with an index at references/docs-index.tsx |
| Topic routing | Utility, variant, config, migration, compatibility, implementation, refactor, review |
| Freshness gate | Stops and asks for re-initialization if the snapshot is older than one week |
| Engineering playbook | references/engineering-playbook.md for implementation and refactor work |

## Quick Start

1. Install: `npx skills add lombiq/tailwind-agent-skills --skill tailwind-4-docs`
2. Run the one-time initialization to sync the docs snapshot
3. Ask: "which Tailwind v4 utilities changed from v3, and how do I migrate this config?"

## CorpusIQ Use Cases

| Use Case | How |
|---|---|
| **Tailwind projects** | Official-guidance answers for v4 work instead of model memory |
| **Migration work** | v3-to-v4 migration questions for client frontends |
| **Docs-style grounding** | A proven pattern for local-docs-snapshot skills we can copy for our own docs |

## Limitations / Verification

- Snyk audit Warn (named on the skill page) - install into a reviewed environment
- Upstream Tailwind docs are source-available, not open-source; you must initialize the snapshot yourself and comply with the upstream license
- Requires re-initialization when the snapshot is older than one week

```bash
npx skills add lombiq/tailwind-agent-skills   # verify install works
```
