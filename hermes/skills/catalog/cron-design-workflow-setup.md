# Cron Design Workflow - Setup Guide

**Source:** [lovenps85/hermes-cron-design-workflow-skill](https://github.com/lovenps85/hermes-cron-design-workflow-skill)
**Category:** Operations / DevOps

A reusable Hermes Agent skill for designing and improving cron jobs, scheduled automations, recurring alerts, and personal operations workflows. Adapts patterns from Superpowers (`brainstorming`, `writing-plans`), Matt Pocock (`grill-me`, `grill-with-docs`, `domain-modeling`), and GSTACK (`office-hours`) into a structured cron design pipeline.

---

## Installation

### Option A: Clone/copy (recommended - preserves references)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lovenps85/hermes-cron-design-workflow-skill.git
mkdir -p ~/.hermes/skills/devops
cp -a hermes-cron-design-workflow-skill/cron-design-workflow ~/.hermes/skills/devops/
```

Then start a Hermes session and load:

```bash
hermes -s cron-design-workflow
```

Or inside Hermes:

```text
/skill cron-design-workflow
```

### Option B: Direct SKILL.md install

```bash
hermes skills install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lovenps85/hermes-cron-design-workflow-skill/main/cron-design-workflow/SKILL.md
```

---

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Details |
|---|---|
| **Hermes Agent** | v0.20.0+ (skill loading support) |
| **Git** | For clone install (Option A) |

---

## Key Capabilities

### Workflow Pipeline

```
Context → Office Hour → Brainstorming → Grill Me → Docs → Execute / Verify
```

| Phase | What Happens | Output |
|---|---|---|
| **Context** | Gather existing crons, schedules, and requirements | Structured requirements doc |
| **Office Hour** | Open Q&A session - explore edge cases, constraints | Clarified scope |
| **Brainstorming** | Generate multiple approaches, evaluate trade-offs | Ranked options |
| **Grill Me** | Stress-test the chosen approach - find failure modes | Hardened design |
| **Docs** | Write the cron spec, schedule, monitoring plan | Deployable documentation |
| **Execute / Verify** | Deploy and validate the cron job | Running automation |

### Core Features

| Capability | How to Trigger | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Design New Cron** | "Design a cron for [purpose]" | Full 6-phase pipeline |
| **Improve Existing Cron** | "Review my [name] cron" | Skips straight to Grill Me phase |
| **Cron Audit** | "Audit all my crons" | Context phase gathers all existing jobs |
| **Documentation** | "Write docs for my crons" | Docs phase with monitoring plan |

## CorpusIQ Use Cases

| Use Case | How |
|---|---|
| **New Automation Design** | "Design a cron to monitor MCP server uptime every hour" |
| **Existing Cron Optimization** | "Review the skills-sweep cron - it's running slow" |
| **Scheduled Report Generation** | "Design a daily HTML report cron for growth metrics" |
| **Watchdog Design** | "Design a watchdog for email inbox monitoring" |
| **Cron Consolidation** | "Audit all crons and suggest consolidation" |

---

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Fix |
|---|---|
| Skill not found | Verify clone path: `ls ~/.hermes/skills/devops/cron-design-workflow/` |
| References missing | Use Option A (clone) - Option B may only install SKILL.md |
| Pipeline stalls | Each phase builds on the last - ensure Context is complete before Office Hour |

## Verification

```bash
# Verify skill installed
hermes skills list | grep cron-design-workflow

# Check references
ls ~/.hermes/skills/devops/cron-design-workflow/references/
# Should show: source-research.md
```
