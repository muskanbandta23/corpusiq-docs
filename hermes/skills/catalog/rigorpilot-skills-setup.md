# RigorPilot Skills - Setup Guide

**Source:** [lllllllama/rigorpilot-skills](https://www.skills.sh/lllllllama/rigorpilot-skills) (2.6M combined installs)
**GitHub:** [github.com/lllllllama/rigorpilot-skills](https://github.com/lllllllama/rigorpilot-skills)
**Category:** Research / ML Engineering
**First Seen:** August 12, 2026
**Quality Tier:** 🟡 Beta (high install volume, young publisher)

RigorPilot packages the full AI-research loop as twelve agent skills: explore a research area, resolve paper context, reproduce experiments, run training, and audit the result - all with safety-first debugging. Every skill carries ~234K installs, making this one of the highest-volume research clusters on skills.sh.

## Installation

```bash
# Install the full repo
npx skills add llllllllama/rigorpilot-skills

# Or install individually
npx skills add llllllllama/rigorpilot-skills --skill ai-research-explore
npx skills add llllllllama/rigorpilot-skills --skill paper-context-resolver
npx skills add llllllllama/rigorpilot-skills --skill safe-debug
```

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Details |
|---|---|
| Node.js + npx | For the skills.sh CLI install path |
| Python ML stack | PyTorch/HF ecosystem for the training-oriented skills |
| GPU access | For `run-train` and reproduction workloads (local or cloud) |
| Git | Repos under study are cloned locally |

## CorpusIQ Use Cases

| Use Case | How |
|---|---|
| **Model evaluation research** | `ai-research-explore` + `paper-context-resolver` for surveying techniques before evals |
| **Agent skill upgrades** | `repo-intake-and-plan` + `explore-code` when assessing new tooling repos for the stack |
| **Safe experimentation** | `minimal-run-and-audit` + `safe-debug` pattern for local AI infrastructure work |

---

## Limitations / Verification

- Newest skill (`ai-paper-reproduction`) has zero installs - treat as alpha
- Verify install: `npx skills list | grep -E "research|rigor"` shows installed entries
- Training skills assume a working GPU environment; they orchestrate, they don't provision hardware
