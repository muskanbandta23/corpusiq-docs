### Code Quality Analysis
Checks function size, code duplication, naming conventions, error handling patterns, and dead code.

### Performance Audit
Identifies unnecessary database queries, inefficient algorithms, missing caching, and memory leak patterns.

### Test Coverage Assessment
Verifies new code has tests, edge cases are covered, and tests are meaningful rather than coverage-only.
