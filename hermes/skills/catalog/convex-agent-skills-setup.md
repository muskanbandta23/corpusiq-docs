Convex is the TypeScript-first backend platform (realtime database, auth, crons, billing) backed by a16z. This is the official agent skill set - the largest single-platform developer-experience cluster outside Microsoft Azure. Agents can stand up a full backend (schema, auth, crons, domains, billing, deploys) end to end without leaving the skill system.

## Prerequisites

- A Convex account (free tier available)
- Node.js 20+ for the CLI (`npx convex dev`)

## CorpusIQ Use Cases

- **Fast internal tool backends** - agent builds a CRUD backend with auth in one session via `convex-quickstart` + `convex-setup-auth`
- **Cron-driven automations** - `convex-crons` schedules recurring functions as a lighter alternative to serverless for small tools
- **Launch readiness** - `convex-launch-readiness` + `convex-deploy-guard` as pre-release gates for customer-facing demos

## Limitations / Verification

- Convex-specific: skills assume the Convex platform, not a generic SQL/Postgres backend
- Verify: `npx convex dev` boots a project and the dashboard shows a new deployment
