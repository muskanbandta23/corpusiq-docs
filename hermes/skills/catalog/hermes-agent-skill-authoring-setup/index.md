## Frontmatter Fields

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|:--------:|-------------|
| `name` | ✅ | Lowercase, hyphens only, max 64 chars. Must match directory name. |
| `description` | ✅ | 1-2 sentences. Appears in skills list and marketplace search. |

## Content Structure Best Practices

### 1. Overview Section

Answer three questions in the first paragraph:
- **What** does it do?
- **When** should an agent load it?
- **Why** use this instead of general knowledge?

### 2. Prerequisites Section

Be specific. Don't say "need API access" - say "OpenAI API key with `gpt-4` model access, set as `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable."

### 3. Workflow Section

Numbered steps with exact commands. Every command should be copy-paste runnable:

```bash
# Good - exact, runnable
python3 scripts/validate.py --input config.yaml

# Bad - vague
validate the configuration file
```

### 4. Pitfalls Section

Document what WILL go wrong and how to fix it:

```
PITFALL: The API returns 401 if the token was generated more than 24 hours ago.
SOLUTION: Regenerate the token and update the environment variable.
```

### 5. Verification Section

How to confirm the skill worked:

```bash
# Check output file exists and is non-empty
test -s output/report.md && echo "PASS" || echo "FAIL"
```

## Publishing to skills.sh

1. Create a public GitHub repo with your `SKILL.md`
2. Tag the repo with `hermes-agent` topic on GitHub
3. skills.sh auto-discovers repos with agent-skill topics
4. Your skill appears on the marketplace within 24 hours

```bash
# Example: publishing a skill
git init my-hermes-skill
cd my-hermes-skill
# Create SKILL.md with proper frontmatter
git add SKILL.md
git commit -m "Initial skill: my-hermes-skill"
gh repo create my-hermes-skill --public --push
gh repo edit --add-topic hermes-agent
```
