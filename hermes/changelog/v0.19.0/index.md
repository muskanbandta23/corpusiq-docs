# Hermes Agent v0.19.0 (v2026.7.20)

**Release Date:** July 20, 2026
**Since v0.18.0:** ~2,245 commits · ~1,065 merged PRs · ~2,465 files changed · ~300,000 insertions · ~36,000 deletions · **~3,300 issues closed** · **450+ community contributors**

> **The Quicksilver Release.** Hermes is the messenger god, and this window we made him move like it. First-turn time-to-first-token dropped **~80% on every platform**, reasoning streams live by default, the desktop app got a ~20-PR speed overhaul, and the TUI renders markdown incrementally. Around that speed spine: manage your Nous subscription without leaving the terminal, plug Bitwarden and 1Password straight into Hermes, let smart approvals judge flagged commands for you, watch your subagents work live, and trust that a finished response survives a gateway crash. This release also rolls up everything from the v0.18.1 and v0.18.2 infrastructure patch tags.

---

## ✨ Highlights

- **~80% faster first-token time** - Cold-start "Initializing agent..." dropped from ~4.3s to ~0.9s across CLI, gateway, TUI, desktop, and cron. Reasoning models now stream their thinking live by default, and the response box paints per token instead of per line. ([#59332](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/pull/59332), [#59389](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/pull/59389))

- **Desktop app speed wave - 20+ targeted perf PRs** - 14× faster streaming markdown, virtualized diffs, snappy session switching, pre-warmed profile backends, and idle-mount boot-hidden panes. The desktop app feels native under load. ([#67154](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/pull/67154), [#67818](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/pull/67818), [#65898](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/pull/65898))

- **Terminal billing - `/subscription` and `/topup`** - See your plan, preview upgrade costs, schedule downgrades, and apply changes - all from the TUI or classic CLI. The desktop app got a matching billing settings tab. ([#51639](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/pull/51639), [#61054](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/pull/61054))

- **Smart approvals are now the default** - An LLM reviewer independently assesses flagged commands instead of asking you to approve every single one. Combined with user-defined deny rules and `/deny <reason>`, approval fatigue drops sharply without giving up control. ([#62661](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/pull/62661), [#59164](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/pull/59164))

- **Bitwarden & 1Password secret sources** - A pluggable `SecretSource` interface fetches API keys from Bitwarden and 1Password (`op://` references) at load time, with multiple vaults, deterministic precedence, and conflict warnings. ([#59498](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/pull/59498))

- **Watch your subagents work - live transcripts + durable background delegation** - `delegate_task` dispatches return live transcript files you can `tail -f`. Background delegation completions are now durable through process restarts via an ownership-checked ledger. ([#67479](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/pull/67479), [#63494](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/pull/63494))

- **Delivery-obligation ledger** - Final responses are recorded in a durable ledger in `state.db` and redelivered on the next boot if the gateway crashes mid-delivery. Closes a P1 silent-loss window for Telegram, Discord, Slack, and every other channel. ([#67181](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/pull/67181))

- **Profile-based message routing** - A single multiplexed gateway sharing one bot token can route specific guilds, channels, or threads to different profiles - each with fully isolated config, skills, memory, and secrets. ([#64835](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/pull/64835), [#65700](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/pull/65700))

- **New providers and frontier models** - Fireworks AI and DeepInfra as first-class providers. Model catalogs: GPT-5.6 (Sol/Terra/Luna + Pro), grok-4.5 (GA), moonshotai/kimi-k3, claude-fable-5 / claude-sonnet-5, tencent/hy3, plus LM Studio JIT loading. ([#62593](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/pull/62593), [#63969](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/pull/63969), [#61616](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/pull/61616))

- **New reasoning effort tiers - `max` and `ultra`** - Selectable everywhere with per-model overrides, per-slot MoA preset effort, and per-task auxiliary effort. Thinking depth is now a dial, not a global switch. ([#62650](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/pull/62650), [#64458](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/pull/64458))

- **Session export to Markdown, Quarto, HTML, and Hugging Face formats** - With full filter surface, optional `--redact` secret-scrubbing, and compacted-session lineage stitching. ([#60186](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/pull/60186))

- **Security hardening round** - Vertex credential scoping, media/vision file-read guards, webhook body-cap sweep, bot-token redaction, six P1 hardening PRs, and CI hardened against untrusted-ref interpolation. ([#57660](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/pull/57660), [#58709](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/pull/58709))

## ⚡ Performance - the speed spine

### First-turn latency (all platforms)
- **~80% TTFT cut** - Discord capability detection off the critical path (token-keyed 24h disk cache), Ollama probe skipped for non-Ollama providers, agent-init blocking work removed; cold submit→dispatch ~4.3s → ~0.9s ([#59332](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/pull/59332))

### Everywhere else
- TUI renders streamed markdown incrementally per block ([#67236](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/pull/67236))
- Skill discovery cached by scan signature; snapshot manifest builds ~5× faster ([#61414](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/pull/61414), [#61131](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/pull/61131))

- `hermes update` skips npm install when Node manifests are unchanged ([#61580](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/pull/61580))
- Byte-stable gateway system prompts - pinned session-context render keeps the prompt cache alive ([#67403](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/pull/67403))
