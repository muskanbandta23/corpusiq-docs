# Hermes Agent v0.18.2 (v2026.7.7.2)

**Release Date:** July 7, 2026

> **Same-day patch on top of v0.18.1.** Picks up the WhatsApp Baileys dependency fix needed for tagged-release Docker builds.

## What's in this patch

- **fix(whatsapp): unpin Baileys from git commit, use published 7.0.0-rc13** ([#60643](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/pull/60643)) - the WhatsApp bridge dependency now installs from the published npm release instead of a pinned git commit, making installs and Docker image builds reliable.

Full curated release notes for the entire post-v0.18.0 window ship with **v0.19.0**.

## Updating

```bash
hermes update        # existing installs
pip install -U hermes-agent
```
