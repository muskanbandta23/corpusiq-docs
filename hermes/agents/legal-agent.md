# Hermes Legal Agent  --  Autonomous Contract Review & Compliance Monitoring

The **Hermes Legal Agent** assists with **contract review, regulatory monitoring, policy enforcement, and audit preparation**. It works as a first-pass legal operations assistant  --  flagging contract risks, tracking regulatory changes, monitoring policy compliance, and organizing documentation for audits and due diligence.

This agent does **not provide legal advice** or replace qualified counsel. It accelerates legal workflows by handling the structured, repeatable parts of legal operations so your legal team can focus on judgment-intensive work. **All findings are framed as "flags for attorney review"** with source references.

## Overview

**The Legal Agent eliminates manual document review and regulatory scanning.** Instead of reading every contract for standard clauses, manually checking regulatory feeds, and scrambling to gather audit evidence, your legal team receives flagged contract deviations, filtered regulatory digests, and audit-ready evidence collections on schedule.

| Capability | What It Does |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Contract review** | First-pass analysis: clause identification, playbook deviation flagging, obligation extraction |
| **Regulatory monitoring** | Tracks agency updates, proposed rules, enforcement actions by jurisdiction |
| **Policy enforcement** | Monitors internal systems for policy violations, flags non-compliant configurations |
| **Audit preparation** | Organizes evidence collection, tracks control testing, generates readiness reports |
| **Document management** | Contract repository organization, version tracking, expiry and renewal calendar |

## How It Works

1. **Connect your legal stack**  --  Google Drive, OneDrive, Dropbox for contracts; Notion/Airtable for databases
2. **Store your contract playbook**  --  Acceptable clauses, flagged clauses, fallback positions in canonical facts
3. **Load the skills**  --  Contract review, regulatory monitor, policy enforcement, audit prep, document management
4. **Schedule the crons**  --  Weekly renewal checks, daily regulatory digests, monthly audit readiness
5. **Attorney reviews all flags**  --  The agent flags, humans decide

## Key Features

- **Weekly contract renewal checks**  --  flags obligations expiring within 90 days
- **Daily regulatory digest**  --  jurisdiction-filtered updates from agency feeds, no noise
- **Compliance scans**  --  weekly checks against internal policies (data access, security, vendor compliance)
- **Monthly audit readiness reports** organized by control framework (SOC 2, ISO 27001, HIPAA, GDPR)
- **Document expiry tracking**  --  certificates, agreements, licenses with 30-day advance warnings
- **Contract playbook deviation flagging**  --  identifies clauses that deviate from your standard positions

## Recommended Model

**Claude Sonnet 4** or **GPT-4o**  --  careful reading, pattern matching against clause libraries, and identifying deviations from standard language. Use **Claude Haiku** for ongoing monitoring and simple policy Q&A. **Always pair with human legal review.**

## MCP Connectors Needed

| Connector | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **Google Drive / OneDrive / Dropbox** | Contract repositories, policy documents, evidence |
| **Notion / Airtable** | Contract databases, compliance trackers, audit checklists |
| **Slack** | Compliance alerts, approval notifications, team coordination |
| **Email** | Contract review requests, regulatory digest distribution |
| **Monday.com** | Legal project tracking, matter management |

## Configuration Notes

- Integrate with your **CLM** (Ironclad, LinkSquares) for end-to-end contract lifecycle management
- Add `litigation-hold` for automated legal hold notifications
- Build a `vendor-due-diligence` skill reviewing vendor security documentation
- Add `ip-portfolio` for patent and trademark deadline tracking
