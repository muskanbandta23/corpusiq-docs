# Hermes Support Agent  --  Autonomous Ticket Triage & SLA Monitoring

The **Hermes Support Agent** is your **first line of defense for customer inquiries**  --  it triages incoming tickets, searches your knowledge base for answers, drafts response templates, monitors **SLA compliance**, and surfaces **trending issues** before they become support crises. Deploy in minutes to handle the repetitive parts of ticket management so your human team can focus on complex, empathy-requiring conversations.

This agent integrates with your helpdesk, knowledge base, CRM, and communication tools through [CorpusIQ MCP connectors](/hermes/mcp/connectors/).

## Overview

**The Support Agent eliminates manual ticket sorting and response drafting.** Every 5 minutes it scans for new tickets, classifies them by type and priority, routes them to the right team, and  --  for common issues  --  drafts complete responses pulled from your knowledge base. Human agents review and send with one click.

| Capability | What It Does |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Ticket triage** | Auto-classification by type, priority, and sentiment; intelligent routing |
| **Knowledge base search** | Semantic search across docs and resolved tickets for answer retrieval |
| **Response drafting** | Generates draft responses for common issues with appropriate tone and brand voice |
| **SLA monitoring** | Tracks time-to-first-response and time-to-resolution; breach risk alerts |
| **Trending issue detection** | Detects emerging issue clusters from multiple similar tickets |

## How It Works

1. **Connect your helpdesk**  --  via API integration with Zendesk, Intercom, Freshdesk, or Help Scout
2. **Link your knowledge base**  --  Notion, Airtable, or Google Drive with support articles and macros
3. **Load the skills**  --  Ticket triage, KB search, response draft, SLA monitor, trending issues
4. **Schedule the crons**  --  Every-5-minute triage, every-30-minute SLA checks, daily summaries
5. **Human agents review**  --  The agent drafts, humans approve and send

## Key Features

- **Every-5-minute ticket triage** during business hours  --  classification, prioritization, routing
- **Auto-drafted responses** for low-complexity tickets (password resets, billing questions, shipping status)
- **SLA breach risk detection** every 30 minutes with escalating alerts to team leads
- **Daily support summary** at 5:30 PM  --  tickets created, resolved, breached
- **Trending issue clustering**  --  detects when 3+ tickets share keywords or error patterns
- **Knowledge base gap analysis**  --  identifies common questions with no existing article

## Recommended Model

**Claude Sonnet 4** or **GPT-4o**  --  nuanced language for customer-facing responses with empathy and brand voice. Use **Claude Haiku** or **GPT-4o Mini** for classification and routing at scale.

## MCP Connectors Needed

| Connector | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **HubSpot / Close CRM** | Customer profile, subscription tier, deal history |
| **Slack** | Ticket alerts, escalation notifications, trending flags |
| **Gmail / Outlook** | Ticket creation from email, thread tracking |
| **Stripe** | Subscription status, payment issues, refund eligibility |
| **Notion / Airtable** | Knowledge base articles, support playbooks, macros |
| **GA4 / PostHog** | Product usage data for troubleshooting |

## Sample Cron Schedule

# Trending issue detection every hour
0 * * * * hermes skill trending-issues --period 4h --min-cluster 3

# Daily support summary at 5:30 PM
30 17 * * 1-5 hermes skill sla-monitor --daily-summary --format slack

# Knowledge base gap analysis every Monday at 9:00 AM

## Quick-Start Command

```bash
hermes agent create support \
  --model claude-sonnet-4 \
  --skills ticket-triage,kb-search,response-draft,sla-monitor,trending-issues,customer-360 \

## Configuration Notes

- Define **SLA targets** (P1: 1h response, P2: 4h, P3: 24h) in canonical facts
- Store **brand voice guidelines, macros, and escalation paths**
- Map **product feature names to knowledge base article tags** for accurate search
- Configure which **ticket fields the agent can modify vs. human-approval-only**

## Extending

- Add `sentiment-escalation` detecting frustrated customers for auto-escalation
- Integrate with **Jira or Linear** for bug report creation from support tickets
- Add `self-service-optimizer` analyzing help center search queries
- Build a `churn-intervention` skill flagging cancellation-risk customers

## FAQ

### What does the Hermes Support Agent do?

The **Hermes Support Agent** autonomously triages incoming support tickets, searches your knowledge base for answers, drafts response templates, monitors SLA compliance with breach alerts, and detects trending issues from ticket clusters  --  all on scheduled crons.

### How does ticket triage work?

Every 5 minutes during business hours, the agent scans for unassigned tickets, **classifies them by type (billing, technical, account, feature request)**, checks priority against customer tier, and **routes to the appropriate team or queue**.

### Can the agent write responses to customers?

Yes. For low-complexity tickets (password resets, billing questions, shipping status), the agent **drafts complete responses** using knowledge base articles and past resolved tickets. **Human agents review and send** with one click  --  the agent never sends without approval.

### How does SLA monitoring work?

The agent checks every 30 minutes for tickets approaching breach. At **50% of SLA**, it sends a gentle reminder. At **75%**, it notifies the team lead. At **90%**, it alerts the manager. After breach, it creates a post-mortem draft.

### What is trending issue detection?

The agent clusters tickets with **similar keywords or error messages**. When 3+ tickets match within 4 hours, it flags a trending issue on Slack with the common pattern, affected customers, and suggested KB article or escalation path.
