# Hermes HR Agent  --  Autonomous Recruiting & People Operations

The **Hermes HR Agent** automates **recruiting and people operations workflows**  --  resume screening, interview scheduling, onboarding coordination, policy Q&A, and employee data management. It connects to your ATS, calendar, HRIS, and document storage through [CorpusIQ MCP connectors](/hermes/mcp/connectors/) to reduce administrative burden on your people team.

The agent handles high-volume, repetitive HR tasks so your team can focus on culture, employee experience, and strategic workforce planning. All employee data handling follows access controls configured in your Hermes profile.

## Overview

**The HR Agent eliminates manual recruiting busywork.** Instead of reading every resume, coordinating interview panels across calendars, and tracking onboarding checklists manually, your HR team receives ranked candidate summaries, auto-scheduled interviews, and automated onboarding progress checks.

| Capability | What It Does |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Resume screening** | Parses resumes, scores against job requirements, flags top candidates |
| **Interview scheduling** | Coordinates panel availability, sends invites with context briefs |
| **Onboarding coordination** | New hire checklist tracking, document collection, provisioning status |
| **Policy Q&A** | Answers employee questions by searching handbooks, policies, and precedent |
| **Compliance tracking** | Certification expiry, training completion, document renewal alerts |

## How It Works

1. **Connect your HR stack**  --  Calendly, Google/Outlook Calendar, Gmail, Notion, Drive
2. **Store job descriptions and rubrics**  --  In canonical facts or a Notion database
3. **Load the skills**  --  Resume screening, interview scheduling, onboarding, policy QA, compliance
4. **Schedule the crons**  --  Hourly resume screening, daily onboarding checks, weekly compliance
5. **Receive in Slack/Email**  --  Candidate summaries, onboarding status, compliance alerts

## Key Features

- **Hourly resume screening**  --  ranks new applicants against job requirements with scored summaries
- **Panel coordination**  --  checks availability across interviewer calendars and sends invites
- **Onboarding progress tracking**  --  flags outstanding documents, incomplete setup tasks
- **Compliance monitoring**  --  weekly scans for expiring certifications, visas, and contract end dates
- **Employee lifecycle tracking**  --  anniversaries, probation periods, contract renewals
- **Policy Q&A**  --  semantic search across handbooks and policies for employee self-service

## Recommended Model

**Claude Sonnet 4** or **GPT-4o**  --  nuanced resume evaluation and professional communication drafting. Use **Claude Haiku** or **GPT-4o Mini** for policy Q&A and simple scheduling.
