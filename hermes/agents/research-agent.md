# Hermes Research Agent  --  Autonomous Market Intelligence & Competitive Research

The **Hermes Research Agent** is your **autonomous market intelligence engine**. It monitors competitors, industry trends, academic literature, patent filings, and news sources to deliver **actionable insights**  --  not raw data dumps. Use it for competitive landscaping, market sizing, technology trend tracking, literature reviews, and strategic intelligence gathering.

Unlike one-off web searches, the Research Agent maintains **persistent monitoring threads** that build knowledge graphs connecting companies, technologies, and market trends so insights compound over time.

## Overview

**The Research Agent replaces manual competitive research.** Instead of periodically checking competitor websites, scanning news feeds, and manually compiling briefs, your team receives scheduled digests and alerts  --  competitor changes detected within hours, weekly market intelligence briefs with cited sources, and literature reviews with confidence ratings.

| Capability | What It Does |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Competitive intel** | Competitor domain monitoring (SEO, traffic, backlinks), product change detection |
| **Market intelligence** | Industry trend analysis, market sizing, TAM/SAM/SOM, funding and M&A tracking |
| **Literature review** | Academic paper discovery, summarization, citation graphing, research gap identification |
| **News monitoring** | Topic-based news aggregation, sentiment analysis, emerging narrative detection |
| **Patent tracking** | Patent filing alerts by company or technology area, IP landscape mapping |

## How It Works

1. **Connect research tools**  --  Ahrefs, Semrush, GA4, YouTube, Notion via [CorpusIQ connectors](/hermes/mcp/connectors/)
2. **Define competitors and topics**  --  Store competitor list, tracked keywords, and research areas in canonical facts
3. **Load the skills**  --  Competitive intel, market intelligence, literature review, news monitor, patent tracking
4. **Schedule the crons**  --  12-hour competitor checks, 4-hour news scans, weekly briefs, monthly patent sweeps
5. **Receive synthesized briefs**  --  Structured reports with cited sources, confidence levels, and recommended actions

## Key Features

- **Competitor monitoring every 12 hours**  --  detects website changes, pricing updates, hiring signals
- **Industry news aggregation** every 4 hours with sentiment analysis and relevance filtering
- **Weekly market intelligence briefs**  --  market moves, competitor activity, emerging trends
- **Monthly patent landscape updates** tracking filings by company and technology area
- **Mid-week literature reviews** sweeping academic databases for new papers in your research areas
- **Persistent knowledge graphs** connecting companies, technologies, and market trends

## Recommended Model

**Claude Sonnet 4** or **DeepSeek V3** (with web search)  --  strong synthesis across diverse sources. Claude's long context window is particularly valuable for literature reviews. Use **Claude Haiku** for ongoing monitoring and alert classification.

## MCP Connectors Needed

| Connector | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **Ahrefs / Semrush** | Competitor SEO, traffic, backlink, keyword monitoring |
| **Google Search Console** | Own-site SEO for competitive context |
| **GA4** | Own-site traffic for market share context |
| **YouTube** | Competitor video content, product demos, conference talks |
| **Notion / Airtable** | Research repository, competitive matrices, brief archives |
| **Slack** | Research alerts, brief distribution |
| **Email** | Newsletter monitoring, alert digests |

## Quick-Start Command

```bash

## Configuration Notes

- Define **competitor list, tracked topics, and research areas** in canonical facts

- Set **brief format preferences**: executive summary first, detailed analysis, source appendix
- Define **citation standards** for all research outputs

## Extending

- Add `sentiment-tracking` monitoring brand and competitor sentiment across social and news
- Integrate with **LinkedIn Sales Navigator** for B2B intelligence
- Add `technology-radar` tracking emerging tech trends
- Build a `due-diligence` skill for company and market research supporting investment decisions
