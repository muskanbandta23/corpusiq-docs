# Hermes Finance Agent  --  Autonomous Accounting & Financial Reconciliation

The **Hermes Finance Agent** automates **financial operations**  --  invoice processing, expense tracking, account reconciliation, and financial reporting. It connects to your accounting platform, payment processor, and expense tools through [CorpusIQ MCP connectors](/hermes/mcp/connectors/) to provide a **real-time financial picture** without manual data entry or spreadsheet wrangling.

This agent is built for finance teams, fractional CFOs, and business owners who need accurate, timely financial data without living inside QuickBooks. It surfaces anomalies, tracks AR aging, and prepares month-end close summaries.

## Overview

**The Finance Agent replaces manual reconciliation and reporting.** Instead of matching Stripe payouts to bank deposits by hand, checking invoice statuses across systems, and building P&L reports in spreadsheets, your team receives automated reconciliation summaries, overdue alerts, and financial reports delivered on schedule.

| Capability | What It Does |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Invoice processing** | Monitors new invoices, flags duplicates, categorizes by GL code, tracks payment |
| **Expense tracking** | Categorizes expenses, flags uncategorized items, detects policy violations |
| **Bank reconciliation** | Matches Stripe payouts to bank deposits, identifies unmatched transactions |
| **AR aging** | Receivables aging report, overdue alerts, customer payment trend analysis |
| **Financial reporting** | Monthly P&L, balance sheet snapshot, cash flow summary, budget vs. actual |

## How It Works

1. **Connect your financial stack**  --  QuickBooks, Stripe, bank feeds via [CorpusIQ connectors](/hermes/mcp/connectors/)
2. **Define your chart of accounts**  --  Store GL codes and expense policies in canonical facts
3. **Load the skills**  --  Invoice processing, expense tracking, reconciliation, AR aging, financial reporting
4. **Schedule the crons**  --  Daily reconciliation, overdue alerts, weekly cash flow, monthly close
5. **Receive in Slack/Email**  --  Reconciliation summaries, overdue invoice alerts, P&L snapshots

## Key Features

- **Daily bank reconciliation** matching Stripe payouts to deposits with gap flagging
- **Overdue invoice alerts** every weekday with customer context and aging buckets
- **Auto-categorization of expenses** using historical patterns and GL mappings
- **Weekly cash flow snapshots** delivered Monday mornings
- **Month-end close checklist** on the 1st  --  reconciles all accounts, generates P&L and balance sheet
- **Duplicate invoice detection** to prevent double payments

## Recommended Model

**Claude Sonnet 4** or **DeepSeek V3**  --  precise numerical reasoning essential for financial data. Avoid models known to hallucinate numbers. Use **Claude Haiku** for scheduled reporting and simple queries.
