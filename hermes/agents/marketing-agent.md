# Hermes Marketing Agent  --  Autonomous SEO, Content & Campaign Analytics

The **Hermes Marketing Agent** is your **autonomous content and campaign operations assistant**. It monitors **SEO performance**, schedules and analyzes social media content, tracks **email campaign metrics**, generates content briefs, and surfaces **competitive intelligence**  --  all on autopilot. Whether you're a solo marketer or leading a growth team, this agent handles the recurring work: weekly performance reports, ranking drop alerts, content refresh suggestions, and competitor domain comparisons.

This agent connects to your analytics, SEO tools, email platforms, and project boards through [CorpusIQ MCP connectors](/hermes/mcp/connectors/) to create a unified marketing command center.

## Overview

**The Marketing Agent replaces manual marketing operations** with scheduled monitoring, reporting, and alerting. Instead of checking GA4, Search Console, Ahrefs, and Klaviyo individually, your team receives consolidated reports and automated alerts delivered to Slack or email.

| Capability | What It Does |
|-----------|-------------|
| **SEO monitoring** | Rank tracking, keyword cannibalization alerts, featured snippet opportunities, Core Web Vitals |
| **Content performance** | Top pages by traffic, engagement, and conversions; content decay detection |
| **Campaign analytics** | Cross-channel performance (email, social, paid) with ROAS calculation |
| **Competitive intelligence** | Competitor content audits, gap analysis, share-of-voice tracking |
| **Social scheduling** | Content calendar management, best-time-to-post analysis, engagement reporting |
