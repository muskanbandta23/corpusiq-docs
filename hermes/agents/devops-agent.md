# Hermes DevOps Agent  --  Autonomous Infrastructure Monitoring & SRE

The **Hermes DevOps Agent** is your embedded **SRE teammate**  --  it monitors **infrastructure health**, triages incidents, analyzes logs, tracks deployment health, and automates routine operations tasks. Deploy in minutes to get real-time operational intelligence without context-switching between dashboards.

This agent connects to your observability stack, CI/CD pipelines, cloud providers, and incident management tools through [CorpusIQ MCP connectors](/hermes/mcp/connectors/). It surfaces issues before they become outages, correlates deployment events with metric anomalies, and accelerates root-cause analysis.

## Overview

**The DevOps Agent eliminates manual infrastructure checking.** Instead of toggling between Datadog, Grafana, and PagerDuty, your engineering team receives proactive alerts with context  --  CPU anomalies correlated with recent deploys, SSL certs expiring in 14 days, and deployment health reports with DORA metrics.

| Capability | What It Does |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Infrastructure health** | CPU, memory, disk, network monitoring with anomaly detection and capacity forecasting |
| **Deployment monitoring** | Success rate, rollback frequency, lead time for changes, change failure rate (DORA metrics) |
| **Incident response** | Alert triage, runbook execution, stakeholder notification, post-incident timelines |
| **Log analysis** | Error pattern detection, cross-service correlation, spike detection, slow-query surfacing |
| **SSL certificate monitoring** | Expiration tracking with renewal reminders |

## How It Works

1. **Connect your infrastructure**  --  PostgreSQL, MSSQL, MongoDB databases; Stripe for payment health
2. **Configure alert routing**  --  Which severity goes to which Slack channel or on-call rotation
3. **Load the skills**  --  Infra health, deployment monitor, incident response, log analysis
4. **Schedule the crons**  --  Every-15-minute health checks, daily deployment reports, weekly cost scans
5. **Receive context-rich alerts**  --  Not just "CPU high" but "CPU spike correlates with deploy #4523 10 min ago"

## Key Features

- **Every-15-minute infrastructure health checks** with anomaly detection
- **Database health monitoring**  --  slow queries, connection pools, replication lag
- **Deployment DORA metrics** tracked daily: lead time, deployment frequency, change failure rate
- **Automatic log correlation** during incidents  --  pulls relevant logs from the alert window
- **SSL certificate expiration tracking** with weekly renewal reminders
- **Weekly cost optimization** scans for idle resources, oversized instances, unattached volumes

## Recommended Model

**Claude Sonnet 4** or **DeepSeek V3**  --  precise technical reasoning, log pattern recognition, and multi-system event correlation. Use **Claude Haiku** for always-on monitoring and simple alert classification.

## MCP Connectors Needed

| Connector | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **PostgreSQL / MSSQL / MongoDB** | Database health, slow queries, connections, replication |
| **Stripe** | Payment infrastructure health, failure rates |
| **Slack** | Incident alerts, deployment notifications, health reports |
| **Email** | On-call notifications, vendor alerts, SSL reminders |
| **GA4 / PostHog** | Application-side error tracking, user-facing errors |

## Sample Cron Schedule

```cron
# Infrastructure health check every 15 minutes
*/15 * * * * hermes skill infra-health --alert-on anomaly

# Database health every 30 minutes
*/30 * * * * hermes skill infra-health --target databases --metrics slow_queries,connections,replication_lag

# Daily deployment report at 9:00 AM
0 9 * * 1-5 hermes skill deployment-monitor --period last_24h

# SSL certificate check every Monday at 8:00 AM
0 8 * * 1 hermes skill ssl-cert-monitor

# Weekly cost optimization scan every Friday at 3:00 PM
0 15 * * 5 hermes skill cost-optimization

# Log error spike check every hour
0 * * * * hermes skill log-analysis --spike-check --period 1h
```

## Quick-Start Command

```bash
hermes agent create devops \
  --model claude-sonnet-4 \
  --skills infra-health,deployment-monitor,incident-response,log-analysis,ssl-cert-monitor,cost-optimization \
  --connectors postgres,slack,email \
  --profile devops \
  --description "Infrastructure monitoring and SRE operations agent"
```

## Configuration Notes

- Define **alert routing rules** (severity → Slack channel/on-call rotation) in canonical facts
- Store **runbook URLs and escalation policies** for incident notifications
- Configure **log sources** and their locations for cross-service correlation
- Set **anomaly detection thresholds per service**  --  a 10% CPU spike on a batch worker differs from the API

## Extending

- Add `chaos-engineering` for scheduled GameDays
- Integrate with **Terraform or Pulumi state** for infrastructure drift detection
- Add `dependency-health` to monitor upstream API dependencies
- Build a `capacity-planner` forecasting resource needs from growth trends

## FAQ

### What does the Hermes DevOps Agent do?

The **Hermes DevOps Agent** autonomously monitors infrastructure health every 15 minutes, tracks deployment metrics (DORA), analyzes logs for error patterns, manages incident response with context-rich alerts, and scans for cost optimization opportunities  --  all delivered to Slack on schedule.

### How does infrastructure health monitoring work?

The agent checks CPU, memory, disk, and network metrics across instances every 15 minutes. When anomalies are detected, it correlates them with recent deployments or traffic changes and alerts with context  --  not just raw metrics.

### Can the DevOps agent help during incidents?

Yes. During incidents, the agent **automatically pulls relevant logs** from the window surrounding the alert, identifies recent deployments or config changes, and **drafts an incident timeline** for post-mortem analysis.

### What DORA metrics does the agent track?

The agent tracks four key **DORA metrics**: deployment frequency, lead time for changes, change failure rate, and time to restore service. Daily reports show trends with week-over-week comparisons.

### How does the agent handle cost optimization?

Every Friday, the agent scans for **idle load balancers, oversized instances, unattached volumes, and reserved instance coverage gaps**  --  delivering a prioritized list of savings opportunities.
