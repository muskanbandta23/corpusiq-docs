# Hermes Executive Agent  --  Autonomous Calendar, Inbox & Daily Briefings

The **Hermes Executive Agent** is your **AI chief of staff**  --  it manages your calendar, prepares meeting briefs, triages your inbox, and delivers a structured **daily briefing** so you start every day with clarity instead of chaos. Designed for founders, executives, and anyone juggling too many priorities.

This agent integrates deeply with your calendar, email, task management, and communication tools through [CorpusIQ MCP connectors](/hermes/mcp/connectors/). It learns your priorities, communication patterns, and working style to provide **proactive, context-rich support**.

## Overview

**The Executive Agent replaces the morning scramble.** Instead of scanning your calendar, digging through email, and reconstructing action items from memory, you receive a 6:30 AM briefing: today's meetings with context, the 3-5 emails that need attention (with suggested responses), pending decisions, and a key metrics snapshot.

| Capability | What It Does |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Daily briefing** | Morning summary: meetings, priority emails, pending decisions, metrics |
| **Calendar management** | Schedule optimization, conflict resolution, meeting prep, travel blocking |
| **Priority inbox** | Email triage into "needs action," "needs awareness," and "can wait" |
| **Meeting preparation** | Per-meeting briefs: attendee bios, recent interactions, open action items |
| **Task follow-up** | Track action items from meetings and emails, flag overdue items |

## How It Works

1. **Connect your personal stack**  --  Google/Outlook Calendar, Calendly, Gmail/Outlook, Slack, Notion, Drive
2. **Define your priorities**  --  Store communication preferences and delegation patterns in canonical facts
3. **Load the skills**  --  Daily briefing, calendar manager, priority inbox, meeting prep, task follow-up
4. **Schedule the crons**  --  5 AM calendar optimization, 6:30 AM briefing, 15-min inbox triage
5. **Receive via email and Slack**  --  Morning briefings, meeting prep docs, task reminders

## Key Features

- **6:30 AM daily briefing** delivered to your inbox  --  meetings, priority emails, decisions, metrics
- **Calendar optimization** at 5 AM  --  resolves conflicts, blocks focus time, ensures travel buffers
- **Every-15-minute inbox triage** during business hours with response drafts
- **Pre-meeting briefs** with attendee bios, recent interactions, and open action items
- **4:00 PM task follow-up** checking delegated items and flagging overdue tasks
- **Friday weekly review**  --  wins, blockers, decisions made, next week's priorities

## Recommended Model

**Claude Sonnet 4** or **GPT-4o**  --  sophisticated prioritization, contextual understanding, and professional communication drafting. Use **Claude Haiku** for daily briefings and scheduling.
