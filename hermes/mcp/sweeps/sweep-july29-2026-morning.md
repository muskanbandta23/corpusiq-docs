# MCP Directory Sweep - July 29, 2026 (Morning)

## Summary

Sweep of mcpservers.org sitemaps (servers/1-6.xml + priority-servers.xml) and mcp.so SSR extraction. Firecrawl + web_search DOWN - used curl-based sitemap scraping (proven fallback pattern). Scanned 175 servers with `lastmod=2026-07-29`, cross-referenced against existing 229-entry catalog.

**Result:** 3 business-critical servers discovered (all absent from catalog), 4 secondary finds noted. 161 false positives (re-indexed existing pages with today's `lastmod`).

Essential for e-commerce and DTC operators running paid social. `github.com/pipeboard-co/meta-ads-mcp` · [Guide →](/hermes/mcp/servers/external/meta-ads-mcp/)

Not official (community-maintained by smn2gnt) but well-implemented with comprehensive object coverage. First dedicated Salesforce MCP server. `github.com/smn2gnt/MCP-Salesforce` · [Guide →](/hermes/mcp/servers/external/salesforce-mcp/)
