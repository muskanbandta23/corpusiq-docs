## Blockers Encountered
- **GitHub Search API:** All queries return "User flagged as spammy" (HTTP 422). The classic PAT at `~/.hermes/profiles/corpusiq/secrets/github.token` (prefix ghp_) has been flagged. Individual repo API calls still work but Search endpoint is unavailable.
- **mcp.so:** SSR-only, no API endpoint. Homepage scraping yielded categories but not individual server listings.
- **mcpservers.org:** SSR-only, but sitemap XML is accessible and was used as primary data source.

## Recommendations
1. **GitHub token:** The current token has been flagged for search spam. Consider rotating to a new classic PAT or using a different account for search queries.
2. **OpusGrowth:** Monitor for public launch. This is the most promising business-operator MCP server found this week.
3. **codeChap servers:** The same developer (codeChap) has multiple MCP servers (LinkedIn, SEO, agent-browser). Worth monitoring their GitHub activity for new releases.
