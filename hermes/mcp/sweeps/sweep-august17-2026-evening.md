# MCP Server Discovery Sweep - August 17, 2026 (Evening)

## Summary

- **9 new business-relevant servers** since the August 17 midday sweep
- **9 integration guides written** (LucidRents, AwardCast, StorePilot, Inside Ads, Bitroad, Secondhand, Atono, xete, Personhood)
- **The human-gated settlement pattern arrives** - xete's draft-then-verify settlement is the approval-gate doctrine applied to money itself
- **Public-records data is productizing into MCP** - LucidRents (buildings) and AwardCast (federal contracts) both package public records into no-auth agent surfaces
- **App portfolio operations gained a cross-store console** - StorePilot joins Google Play and the App Store into one 34-tool stdio server

## Key Observation

The 9 finds split into three patterns. (1) Public records are the new no-auth data layer - LucidRents and AwardCast both package government and municipal records into free, credential-free agent surfaces, extending the public-data trend from GovTrade and Taiwan Law into real estate and federal procurement. (2) The human-gate is now being applied to money itself - xete's draft-then-verify settlement (agent drafts, cannot sign, independent verify before human signature) is the strongest enforcement yet of the agent-proposes-human-disposes doctrine, and Bitroad's spending caps apply the same idea to procurement. (3) Store operations are consolidating - StorePilot joins WisWes Magento and Mercopilot in making commerce surfaces agent-addressable, this time across both app stores at once. Personhood also marks the de-AI content stack's arrival as a hosted, per-generation-billed utility, sitting alongside Prose Coach and Etincel as the third delivery model for voice-controlled text.
