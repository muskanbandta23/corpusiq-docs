## Finds

### EM+x - board-ready deliverables from chat
Remote Streamable HTTP server (33 tools, OAuth) that turns conversation into steerco readouts, executive briefs, market scans, and QBR decks - brief files itself from chat, storyline approved before drafting, deterministic quality gates + adversarial partner review, native .pptx/.docx on the user's own templates. Free: 1 project + 5 revisions/mo; paid from $8/mo. `emplusx.com/api/mcp`, by Cubed Studios. Submitted to mcp.so ~8h before this sweep - genuinely new since the afternoon sweep.

### ATLASS OS - field-service ERP with a native MCP surface
Business platform for construction trades (CRM, scheduling, jobs, double-entry books, GST, payroll, payables, inventory) with 58 MCP tools (35 write-capable, 32 permission scopes), machine-censused Aug 10, 2026. Tokens minted in-app; per-call permission checks; every financial write posts balanced double-entry to an append-only audit log; no payment rail by design. Founding-stage rollout in Alberta. `app.atlass-os.com/mcp`. First field-service platform with a working write-capable MCP surface.

### CiteRank - AI search visibility as agent tools
Five MCP tools over an AI-visibility audit suite: URL audits (schema, E-E-A-T, agentic readiness, AI citation score), brand citation checks in Google AI Overviews/Gemini (citation rate, share of voice, competitor analysis), JSON-LD schema generation, agentic-readiness tests (llms.txt, WebMCP, A2A, potentialAction), and agent-journey simulation (book/quote/contact/buy/subscribe). `citerankscore.com/api/mcp-server`. Purpose-built for GEO/AEO programs.

### QTask - self-hosted task management MCP (catalog entry)
Open-source task/project management with built-in MCP server: list/create/update tasks and projects, staged write approval (AI proposes, human approves), semantic search. Self-hosted via Docker + Ollama; hosted qtask.dev available. `github.com/dbeasty/qtask`.

## Cross-reference notes

- **Excluded - catalog-spam burst:** the ~30-entry single-author rudrendupaul burst on mcpservers.org /all page 1 was excluded per the Aug 12 spam-burst doctrine; not cherry-picked.
- **Already covered by prior sweeps:** Clipkit (Aug 12 morning sweep guide exists at `/hermes/mcp/servers/external/clipkit-mcp/`), Prose Coach/ROIC.ai/cloro/Stratyfix/FlowyTeam/QuestDB (afternoon sweep), Syncro/Bastion/wecallio/Klarefi (Aug 11 midday skip list), SonaPrompt/sshmng/ohm/mercury-cortex (afternoon sweep skip list), Sightseer/scvd.store/directree/crosscode-cli (Aug 11 evening skip list).
- **Skipped this sweep:** SceneF (consumer), LabTestSuperstore (lab supplies, re-noted), AgentBrink (agent identity infra), swag2mcp (OpenAPI→MCP dev bridge), US Stocks & Market Data gino.im (overlaps catalogued ROIC.ai), PyPI MCP + ~10 dev/utility entries.
- **Pattern:** the afternoon sweep's "human-gate" observation extends - EM+x (approve-before-draft) and ATLASS OS (scoped, audited writes) both make the human approval boundary the product, one for output, one for money.
