## Notes

- Fresh issue window was thin on catalogue-worthy submissions; 8/15 fresh issues were class-skips (consistent with prior same-day sweeps).
- Santismm and hot-trending both probed keyless live; Santismm skipped on the educational-content doctrine despite a healthy 30-tool surface.
- mcp.so homepage recentServers was 8/8 prior-sweep dispositions except Furrow Forms (Developer Tools; not evaluated this sweep - dev-adjacent listing, pending detail fetch in a future cycle).
- No report file existed for the Sep 2 midday sweep (its section in index.md is the source of record).
