# MCP Directory Sweep - July 30, 2026

## Summary

Morning sweep of mcpservers.org sitemaps (6 server sitemaps + priority sitemap) and mcp.so /servers page (76 servers on first page). Firecrawl + web_extract DOWN - used curl + sitemap scanning (proven fallback). Last comprehensive sweep was July 29 afternoon (~20 hours ago).

**Result:** 1 business-relevant server discovered (IBANforge), ~300+ sitemap re-indexes noted. mcpservers.org still at ~10,377 servers. mcp.so at 18,065 servers.

## ★ Noted (No Guides)

| Server | Source | Category | Notes |
|--------|--------|----------|-------|
| Orders of Magnitude - x402 API Catalog | mcp.so featured | Agent Infrastructure | 1000+ pay-per-call API endpoints via x402 on Base/USDC. Finance, weather, geography, economic data. Interesting but infrastructure-layer, not direct business tool. `github.com/OrdersOfMagnitudeLLC` |
| Termany | mcp.so featured | Developer Tools | Agent-Native Terminal. Developer-focused, not business-ops. |
| Floors.live | mcp.so featured | Events | Event floor plan designer with 32 tools. Niche (event planning). |
| Glasswarp | mcp.so featured | Infrastructure | See and control a real Windows PC from MCP. BYOH. DevOps/IT, not business-ops. |

## Already Covered / Developer Tools / Skipped

- **mcpservers.org priority sitemap (July 30 entries):** All 12 servers are re-indexes of existing major servers (chrome-devtools, context7, github, metabase, n8n, sentry, serena, stripe, supabase, terraform, desktop-commander). No new business servers.
- **mcpservers.org sitemaps 1-6 (300+ unique July 30 slugs):** Overwhelmingly GitHub usernames (individual developer repos). Product-name slugs (cloudflare, grafana, neo4j, figma, thoughtspot, bucketco, etc.) are re-indexes of existing servers, not new creations.
- **mcp.so first page remaining servers:** All previously catalogued or developer/consumer tools (PuzzleTide, Dadan, Kavel, SVGator, Designesy, extentos, etc.)

---

## Notable Ecosystem Observation

The mcpservers.org `lastmod` field does NOT equal creation date. Over 300+ server pages were re-crawled on July 30, but these are overwhelmingly re-indexes of existing pages - not new server submissions. The sitemap-based discovery approach is becoming less useful for finding genuinely new servers; the mcp.so featured/newest page is a better signal for new submissions.
