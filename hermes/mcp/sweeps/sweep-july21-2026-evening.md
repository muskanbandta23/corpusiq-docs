# MCP Server Sweep - July 21, 2026 (Evening)

Discovered 28 new MCP servers from mcpservers.org's direct-submission feed - servers that bypass the awesome-mcp-servers PR queue entirely. 15 integration guides drafted for business-operator-relevant servers.

**Source:** mcpservers.org /all page (JSON-LD extraction, 30 newest servers)
**Previous sweep:** July 20, 2026 (8 servers from awesome-mcp-servers PRs)
**This sweep:** 28 new servers (14 business-operator-relevant + 14 niche)

## Methodology

Web tools (Firecrawl) unavailable on this node. Used:

1. **mcpservers.org /all page** - SSR extraction via `curl` parsing JSON-LD schema data - 30 newest-listed servers extracted with full descriptions, URLs, and categories
2. **Cross-reference** - All 30 candidates checked against existing catalog (169+ entries in `servers/external/`)
3. **Filtering** - 2 of 30 already in catalog (Superserve, OpenInvestOp). 28 net-new.
