Packy Tracking MCP is the official hosted MCP for the Packy parcel-tracking API: 10 tools mapped onto the Tracking API (trackings_create/list/get/delete, couriers_list, courier_detections_create, webhooks_list/create/update/delete). OAuth 2.1 with API-key fallback (bearer or X-API-Key header). Credit-based pricing: 1 credit per unique tracking number on trackings_create only; reads, courier detection, and webhook tools are free. Public liveness endpoints (/health, /ready) require no key. Repo (packy-tracking/packy-tracking-mcp) is integration docs only, 0 stars, license not declared, no official registry record yet.
