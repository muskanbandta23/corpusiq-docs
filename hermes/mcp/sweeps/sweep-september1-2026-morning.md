## Catalogued (4)

| Server | Source | Verification chain |
|--------|--------|--------------------|
| Gridar MCP | issue #3868 | Endpoint mcp.gridar.app/mcp initialize 401-verified live (JSON-RPC Unauthorized, OAuth flow URL in error body - liveness signal per the Jitsu class). Registry app.gridar/gridar v0.7.0 confirms repo TokDar2410621/blog-dashboard subfolder mcp-server (public, 0 stars, no license declared, created Feb 2026, pushed Sep 1 2026). 69 tools capability-level from the submission; anonymous enumeration refused by the OAuth 2.1 gate. |
| Hive Intelligence MCP | issue #3869 | Live probe mcp.hiveintelligence.xyz/mcp: initialize 200, all 8 root tools captured with descriptions (get_token_price, check_token_safety, get_wallet_portfolio, search_tools, get_api_endpoint_schema, invoke_api_endpoint, invoke_stateful_endpoint, validate_task_result). 607-tool catalog behind the search-then-invoke dispatcher. Registry xyz.hiveintelligence/mcp v1.1.4. Repo hive-intel/hive-sdk (MIT, 18 stars, created Aug 2025). Keyless 25 calls/IP/day. |

Hosted endpoint mcp.ranki.io per README config; anonymous probe inconclusive (405 at root, 404 at /mcp route - the npm stdio packages are the verified consumable path, noted in the guide). |

## Catch-up candidates (recorded for future sweeps)

- **LinkUpAPI** (docs-linkupapi-com-api-reference-mcp-setup) - LinkedIn outreach actions: search people and companies, engagement intent signals, invitations and messages. Sales & Outreach class candidate.
- **GridNews** (gridnews/mcp) - market news, press releases and ticker sentiment. Financial news data candidate.
- **Perception** (perception-to-integrations-mcp) - real-time digital asset narrative intelligence, 31 tools. Paid analytics data candidate.
- **mlab.sh** (doc-mlab-sh-...) - threat intel: IOC enrichment, CVE and actor search, SBOM scanning. Security data candidate.
- **urdigitalau mcp-integrations family** (4 packages: Bing Webmaster Tools 12 tools, MS Clarity, Cloudflare, WordPress 46 tools; WordPress package homepage-listed as fresh) - personal integration collection; Bing Webmaster Tools is the SEO-data catch-up candidate.

## Notable dispositions

- **Sibling-race resolved by rebase, not conflict:** a late-day sweep (commit 69603f9b6) landed between my initial fetch and rebase, cataloguing the issues window #3858-#3863. The fresh-window cutover was derived from that commit's index section, so no duplicate guides were written.
- **mcpservers.org homepage hydration changed again:** the numeric latest-ids array (evening sweep found ids 12458-12464) is absent from this morning's shell; 18 homepage slugs were mostly famous-name re-indexes plus one fresh urdigitalau-wordpress slug.
- **mcp.so homepage was 100% prior-sweep dispositions** (Atomic Mail re-listing with future-dated createdAt artifact, CarChat, file2markdown, BiGapi, DrillerDB, MagicPixel.art, Forency, TikTok Transcript) - confirms the same-day doctrine that issues plus /all carry the yield.
- **MCPg resubmission check:** the #3864 issue resubmits the Aug 19 prose-catalogued entry (index line 2831, repo devopam/MCPg) which has no guide dir - BuyWhere precedent applied.
- **Fastcrawl vs rasterly precedent:** both are Firecrawl-alternative scraping APIs; rasterly (#3676) was skipped as saturated web-scraping category, Fastcrawl follows.
- **Gridar OAuth 401 mined for the flow URL:** the 401 error body carried the OAuth flow URL, consistent with the Forency 401-body-mining recipe.
- **Ranki probe inconclusive but consumable verified:** hosted endpoint route negotiation returned 405/404 on anonymous probes; the two published npm packages (server + hosted shim) are the verified consumable path, README config is the source of record.

## Commit

- Guides: gridar-mcp, hive-intelligence-mcp, ranki-mcp, stackscope-mcp
- Index: top section + tail block + last-updated line (460 servers, +346 guides)
- Validation: 4/4 guides clean (YAML, lengths, em-dash, credential-guard, See Also dirs + labels via index-label fallback for the corrupt-title targets); repo validate_frontmatter.py gate green
