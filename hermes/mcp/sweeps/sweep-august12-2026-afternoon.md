# MCP Server Discovery Sweep - August 12, 2026 (Afternoon)

**Timestamp:** 2026-08-12 (afternoon, UTC)  
**Sources scanned:** mcpservers.org /all pages 1-3 (90 newest servers, curl + regex slug extraction), mcp.so Feed (30 newest submissions, web_extract), mcp.so server detail pages (9 fetched for endpoint/auth/tool verification)  
**New servers found:** 10 business-relevant (6 guides written, 4 catalog entries)

---

## Summary

- **10 genuinely new business-relevant servers** since the Aug 12 morning sweep (~6 hours ago)
- **6 integration guides written** with verified endpoints, auth models, tool lists, and CorpusIQ integration sections
- **mcpservers.org /all reachable** (page 1 + 2 + 3, 90 unique slugs) - the morning sweep reported 504 timeouts on it; recovered this cycle
- **mcp.so Feed productive** - 30 submissions in ~5 days, several never surfaced in directory views
- **Two ecosystem patterns:** (1) human-gate content tooling - Prose Coach (deterministic de-AI filter), BanProof (script compliance), Plainpaper (human-approved campaigns); (2) financial-data MCPs keep compounding - ROIC.ai joins the 5+ market-data servers already catalogued

## Methodology

1. **mcpservers.org /all** - curl pages 1-3, regex-extracted 90 server slugs
2. **mcp.so /feed** - web_extract, 30 newest submissions with timestamps
3. **Cross-reference** - all 90 slugs + 30 feed names OR-searched against the catalog index.md; any hit verified individually with `grep -n`
4. **Detail verification** - 9 mcp.so server detail pages fetched for endpoints, auth, and tool lists (no unverified claims in guides)
5. **Business-relevance filter** - HIGH → guide; notable MEDIUM → catalog entry; rest → also-identified

## Morning Sweep Note

The Aug 12 morning sweep's 6 servers (Orcha ★★★, Clipkit ★★, FiatDock ★★, Apiosk ★★, directree ★★, LocalCan ★) have guides at `/hermes/mcp/servers/external/{orcha,clipkit,fiatdock,apiosk,directree,localcan}-mcp/` but were never added to the catalog index body. This afternoon sweep's catalog update counts them in the totals (Catalog: 162 servers, +58 guides) for accuracy; their entries remain in the morning sweep report.

## Key Observations

1. **Human-gate content tooling is the trend.** Prose Coach (deterministic de-AI filter), BanProof (policy compliance before publish), and Plainpaper (human approval board) all insert a human gate or deterministic check between the agent and the publish button. The ecosystem is shipping answers to the #1 operator objection: "agents write content that sounds like agents."
2. **Financial-data MCPs keep compounding.** ROIC.ai is the 6th market-data/finance MCP catalogued this month. Category saturation means differentiation now comes from coverage breadth (60K companies) and transcript access, not raw price feeds.
3. **AI-engine visibility is becoming its own category.** cloro joins AI Footprints and similar tools in the "what do AI engines say about you" space - the GEO measurement layer the worldwide-promotion playbook needs.
