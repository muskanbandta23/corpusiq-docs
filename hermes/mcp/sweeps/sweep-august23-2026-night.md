## Notes

- Octura endpoint live-probed with the skill's mcp-tools-probe.py: initialize returned com.octurasolutions/site-tools v1.0.0 and tools/list returned 30 tools (README advertises 24) - probe is ground truth, guide reflects the live 30.
- PassportCraft recovered via the ApexVol upgrade path: the mcpservers.org page was thin ("No documentation available") but the vendor connector page (passportcraft.com/connector) documented the full OAuth connection flow, so the candidate was upgraded from thin-docs skip to guide.
- NotFair Plugin's directory description ("hosted Google Ads MCP with 117 tools") does not match its repo (a SKILL.md workflow library) - excluded under the skills-catalog class, never assert listing claims over repo truth.
- Mac Mini unreachable (SSH timeout, known partial-sleep pattern); entire sweep run from the Spark clone (fresher at 327 servers / +213 guides before this sweep).
- Walmart Marketplace MCP README carries explicit verification honesty (5 operation families verified against production, rest spec-wired); captured in the guide rather than hidden.
- Catalog index updated: 327 to 338 servers (+213 to +224 guides).
