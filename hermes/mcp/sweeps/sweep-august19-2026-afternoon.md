# Sweep Report - August 19, 2026 (Afternoon Cron Sweep)

**Shift:** Afternoon (~16:20 UTC)
**Sources scanned:**
- chatmcp/mcpso GitHub issues - 5 fresh submissions after the morning cutoff #3644 (filed Aug 19 10:55 through 16:03 UTC)
- mcp.so homepage SSR (`recentServers`) - 5 entries, all repeats (CSOAI org previously noted July 3; Waqi, Bitroad, FineData, TravelAnimator already catalogued/skipped)
- mcpservers.org homepage - 17 slugs, all previously reviewed in the morning sweep (Austin MLS, My AskAI, a9n9, eCourts India) or famous names

**Result:** 4 new servers catalogued with guides, 1 skipped (sports data precedent), index updated.

## Catalogued (4 new, 4 guides)
