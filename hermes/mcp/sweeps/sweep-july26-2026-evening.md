## mcpservers.org Sampled Sitemaps

- **Sitemap 1 (priority):** 1,190+ entries - top entries filtered above. Also noted: chrome-devtools-mcp (updated Jul 26), sentry-mcp (updated Jul 24), supabase-mcp (updated Jul 24), terraform-mcp (updated Jul 24). All existing or non-business.
- **Sitemaps 2-3:** Sampled ~50 entries each. Mostly niche/consumer (anime-mcp-server, paint-master, replicate-minimax-image, etc.). No business-relevant discoveries.
- **Sitemaps 4-6:** Not sampled (diminishing returns after sitemaps 1-3).

## mcp.so

Homepage SSR scrape showed 8 recent servers. All were either:
- Already in catalog (Groundwork, Goalie, Oromi, PLUR)
- Previously noted (AptiBuild AI, Medplum)
- Not business-relevant (Kavel Image Studio - AI image gen, SecretCarousel - dev tool)

No new business-relevant servers from mcp.so since the cron sweep ~12 hours ago.

## Blockers

- **web_search / web_extract:** Firecrawl not configured (persistent). Used curl + manual HTML parsing throughout.
- **GitHub API:** Not tested this sweep. mcpservers.org sitemaps were sufficient for discovery.

## Catalog Update

- **Added guides:** stripe-mcp, metabase-mcp, n8n-mcp, apify-mcp, ahrefs-mcp (5 new)
- **Noted:** Serena MCP, Desktop Commander MCP
- **Total catalog:** 100 servers (+5 from last sweep)
- **Guides written this sweep:** 5

## Significance Assessment

This was the most consequential sweep in July. Five major platforms - Stripe, Metabase, n8n, Apify, and Ahrefs - all shipped MCP endpoints within a 24-hour window. This represents an inflection point: **MCP has crossed the chasm from developer tooling protocol to platform-standard integration layer.** The fact that Stripe (payments), Metabase (BI), and Ahrefs (SEO) - category-defining platforms in their respective spaces - chose to ship official MCP servers signals that MCP is becoming table stakes for SaaS platforms targeting AI-agent interoperability.
