# MCP Server Discovery Sweep - August 12, 2026

## Summary

- **6 genuinely new business-relevant servers found** since the August 11 evening sweep (~16 hours ago)
- **6 integration guides written** with full setup, tool descriptions, and verdicts
- **mcpservers.org was unreachable** (504 timeout on /all page) - mcp.so was primary source
- **mcp.so continues strong** - >22,000 servers, consistently adding 10-20/day

## Methodology

1. **mcp.so homepage** - Extracted Featured, Trending, and New Arrivals sections
2. **mcp.so /servers?sort=latest** - 30 newest servers (sorted newest-first)
3. **Cross-reference** - All candidates checked against the 200+ server catalog
4. **Business-relevance filter** - Only servers useful for business operators catalogued
5. **Individual server pages** - Extracted full details, tools, and configs from mcp.so detail pages
6. **mcpservers.org** - Attempted but timed out (504); no data captured from this source

## New Findings

### ★★★ Clipkit MCP - Catalogued with Guide

**What:** Video infrastructure for AI agents. Compose motion-graphics video from JSON documents via open Clipkit Protocol. Validate before rendering, preview stills in-chat, deterministic GPU output.

**Why it matters:** Video production is a top-3 operator pain point. Clipkit is the most production-ready agent-native video tool observed - protocol-first with deterministic rendering. Combines with HeyGen (UGC) and ViewMade (YouTube SEO) for a three-tier video stack.

**Guide:** `/hermes/mcp/servers/external/clipkit-mcp/`

---

### ★★★ Orcha MCP - Catalogued with Guide

**What:** Unified context layer for AI tools and agents. Stores organizational knowledge (files, databases, connected sources) with permissions, citations, and provenance. Agents query via MCP, CLI, or REST API.

**Why it matters:** The "context problem" is the #1 blocker for AI agents in business. Orcha provides a structured, permissioned knowledge layer - not just documents, but queryable databases. Different from PLUR (session memory) or Notion MCP (documents only).

**Guide:** `/hermes/mcp/servers/external/orcha-mcp/`

---

### ★★ FiatDock MCP - Catalogued with Guide

**What:** Agent marketplace with x402 per-call USDC payments. 24+ live MCP services, non-custodial settlement, on/off-ramp between USDC and fiat (EU/EEA). Agents discover and pay each other directly.

**Why it matters:** Signals the emergence of an agent-native economy. Per-call pricing ($0.001-$0.01), non-custodial, no subscriptions - the right architecture for agent commerce. Currently crypto/DeFi services; business APIs are the missing piece.

**Guide:** `/hermes/mcp/servers/external/fiatdock-mcp/`

---

### ★★ Apiosk MCP - Catalogued with Guide

**What:** AI-native payments infrastructure - 42 tools for discovering, paying for, executing, and publishing monetized APIs. Per-call USDC settlement over x402. Federated discovery across multiple marketplaces.

**Why it matters:** Most complete agent-payments solution observed. Wallet management, API publishing, federated discovery - the "Stripe for AI agents." Operators could publish paid APIs; agents could pay per call for business data.

**Guide:** `/hermes/mcp/servers/external/apiosk-mcp/`

---

### ★★ directree MCP - Catalogued with Guide

**What:** Query the honest software directory from any AI assistant. Reviews labeled by provenance: observed (crawled), AI-inferred (model-generated), and founder-edited (verified by owner).

**Why it matters:** Software selection is a persistent operator pain point. directree's provenance labeling is genuinely useful in an affiliate-dominated landscape. Currently early-stage with unknown directory coverage.

**Guide:** `/hermes/mcp/servers/external/directree-mcp/`

---

### ★ LocalCan MCP - Catalogued with Guide

**What:** Give AI agents public URLs (tunnels) for localhost, live HTTP traffic inspection, snapshot publishing. ngrok alternative with MCP-native interface.

**Why it matters:** Utility tool for operators who demo local work or test webhook integrations. Not a core growth tool but useful for technical operators.

## Ecosystem Observations

1. **Agent commerce is accelerating.** FiatDock, Apiosk, Sphere, and Orders of Magnitude all launched within 2 weeks - all building on x402/USDC for agent payments. This is not a coincidence; the infrastructure layer is forming.

2. **Video production is the most contested MCP category.** Clipkit, AI Video MCP by AITuber, ViewMade, and Kavel Image Studio all launched recently. Each approaches video differently (JSON protocol vs prompt-driven vs research-first).

3. **Knowledge management is fragmenting.** Orcha, Groundwork, PLUR, AgenticMemory, and SecretCarousel all address "agent context" but from different angles: organizational knowledge, company memory, session memory, persistent memory, and secret management.

4. **mcpservers.org reliability is declining.** Second consecutive sweep where the /all page timed out. mcp.so is now the more reliable primary source.

## Catalog Stats

- **Total servers catalogued:** 200+ (prior) + 6 (this sweep) = **206+ servers**
- **Guides written this sweep:** 6
- **Business-relevant hit rate:** 6/30 (20%) - consistent with historical average
