# MCP Sweep - July 26, 2026 (Afternoon Cron - ~18:00 UTC)

## Summary
- **Method:** mcpservers.org /all JSON-LD (30 newest) + mcp.so sitemap page 19 + chatmcp/mcpso GitHub issues
- **Compared against:** 93 existing catalog entries
- **New servers discovered since last sweep (July 26 12:00 UTC):** 2 (business-relevant)
- **Guides written:** 2

## Blockers
- **GitHub API rate-limited:** Authenticated `gh api` calls hit rate limit. Switched to unauthenticated `curl` for repo lookups. Individual repo API calls worked; `gh search repos` still blocked ("User flagged as spammy").
- **awesome-mcp-servers PR queue:** Rate limited, skipped this sweep.
- **Firecrawl:** Still unconfigured. All extraction via curl.

## Previously Noted Servers (No Change)

| Server | Status | Why No Guide |
|--------|--------|--------------|
| BountyVerdict Agent Decision Tools | Noted July 23 | Developer-focused (GitHub bounties, CI flake detection, MCP tool drift). Not business ops. |
| Retasc | mcpservers.org /all | Unknown business model, no website content. Monitoring. |
| Santiment | mcpservers.org /all | Crypto market data - not general business ops. |
| AIQUAA Playwright | mcpservers.org /all | Testing tool for developers. |

## Already Cataloged (Confirmed, No Action)

The following servers appeared in today's scans but were already in our catalog from July 21 or earlier sweeps:
- FreshBooks MCP, BuiltWith MCP, KPI Depot MCP, 1ClickReport MCP (July 21)
- CDN.MN, TaskerArmy Agent, Reelier, Taplio, iGaming Tools, Outside Agent, Fixou, Argus Testing, KoreanAds, Routara LLM Gateway, AI Consensus, Index One, Agent Browser MCP (July 23-24 sweeps)
- FeatureBoard, Confluence to Markdown (July 23 sweep)
- Oromi Agent Services (July 26 morning sweep)

## mcpservers.org /all Page - Current Top 30

The JSON-LD extraction returned 30 servers. All 30 matched existing catalog entries (either full guides written or noted as low relevance). The `/all` page tracks the 30 most recently added servers - this confirms no new servers were added to mcpservers.org between our morning sweep (~12:00 UTC) and now (~18:00 UTC).

## mcp.so Sitemap Page 19 - Notable Non-Business Entries

~280 servers on page 19. Extracted all - overwhelming majority are test repos ("hello-world-test", "mcp-server-demo-*", "weather-mcp-server-*"), single-platform utilities (Pokemon, RuneScape, Minecraft), or non-English entries. Filtered to business-relevant candidates and cross-referenced against catalog - none were genuinely new and business-relevant. Examples of what was filtered:
- `mailchimp-mcp-server-by-cdata` - CData connector, likely wrapper (already covered by existing CData integrations)
- `shopify-mcp-server-abhi-tapestry` - Shopify (CorpusIQ covers this natively)
- `stripe-mcp-client` - Stripe (CorpusIQ covers this natively)
- `airwallex` - Cross-border payments (interesting but single-platform)
- Various `linkedin-ads-*`, `google-ads-*` - Covered by OpusGrowth MCP
