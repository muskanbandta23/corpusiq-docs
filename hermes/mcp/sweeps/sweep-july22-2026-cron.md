# MCP Server Sweep - July 22-23, 2026 (Cron Discovery)

Automated cron-triggered sweep of mcp.so and mcpservers.org, cross-referenced against the existing 196-server catalog. 14 net-new servers identified, 8 integration guides drafted for business-operator-relevant finds.

**Source:** mcp.so (homepage SSR data) + mcpservers.org (homepage SSR data)
**Previous sweeps:** July 22 morning (8 from mcp.so), July 22 evening (47 from GitHub API)
**This sweep:** 14 net-new, 8 high-value guides created
**Total catalog:** 204+ servers now tracked

## Methodology

1. Scraped mcp.so homepage - extracted recent + featured servers from SSR JSON payload
2. Scraped mcpservers.org homepage - extracted latest + featured servers from SSR JSON payload
3. Cross-referenced all candidates against existing catalog (`servers/external/`)
4. Filtered duplicates (already in evening sweep, already in morning sweep)
5. Prioritized business-operator-relevant servers for guide creation

## Headline Finds (★ = operator relevance)

| Server | Source | Category | Why It Matters |
|--------|--------|----------|----------------|
| **Goalie Trademark Search MCP** ★★★ | mcp.so | IP/Legal | 14M+ USPTO trademark records. First dedicated trademark MCP. Brand clearance + competitive IP monitoring from any agent. |
| **FeatureBoard MCP** ★★★ | mcpservers.org | AI Operations | Agentic governance + orchestration + task planning. First MCP server specifically for managing AI agent operations. |
| **Routara LLM Gateway** ★★ | mcpservers.org | AI Infrastructure | 787+ chat/image/video models behind one OpenAI-compatible MCP endpoint. Single config for multi-model access. |
| **Outside Agent** ★★ | mcpservers.org | AI Agents | Build + deploy production AI agents to web, SMS, and phone from your coding agent. Multi-channel from one definition. |
| **Confluence to Markdown MCP** ★★★ | mcpservers.org | Knowledge Management | Hybrid search over locally-synced Confluence content. Offline-capable, no API rate limits. |
| **Reelier** ★★★ | mcp.so | AI Operations | Agent workflow recording + deterministic replay at zero tokens. Drift detection, compliance audit trail. |
| **Moxie Docs** ★★ | mcp.so | Documentation | Auto-generated codebase docs, MCP context for agents, doc drift detection, Friday Cleanup PRs. |
| **FT Optix MCP** ★★ | mcp.so | Industrial | First industrial automation MCP - connects FT Optix Studio (SCADA/HMI/IoT) to LLMs. |

## Integration Guides Created (8)

1. **Goalie Trademark Search MCP** - 14M USPTO records. Brand clearance + competitor IP monitoring.
2. **FeatureBoard MCP** - Agentic governance, orchestration, task planning. First agent ops MCP.
3. **Routara LLM Gateway MCP** - 787+ models, OpenAI-compatible. Multi-model routing.
4. **Outside Agent MCP** - Deploy agents to web/SMS/phone. Multi-channel production.
5. **Confluence to Markdown MCP** - Offline Confluence search. No API rate limits.
6. **Reelier MCP** - Agent workflow recording + deterministic replay. Audit trail.
7. **Moxie Docs MCP** - Auto-generated docs + drift detection + cleanup PRs.
8. **FT Optix MCP** - Industrial automation. SCADA/HMI to LLM bridge.

## Key Observations

1. **Agent operations tooling is emerging as a category.** FeatureBoard (governance) + Reelier (audit/replay) represent a new MCP subcategory: tools for managing AI agents themselves, not just tools for AI agents to use. This is the beginning of the "agent ops" layer.

2. **IP and legal MCPs are arriving.** Goalie Trademark Search is the first dedicated IP MCP server, following Patsnap (patent search, morning sweep) and Lawstronaut (legal research). Legal/compliance is becoming a distinct MCP vertical.

3. **Industrial MCP is real.** FT Optix MCP bridges the OT/IT gap - factory floor data accessible from AI agents. Combined with OPC UA MCP (otgate, evening sweep), industrial automation is emerging as an MCP vertical.

4. **Remote MCP adoption growing.** Outside Agent and Routara both use remote MCP (HTTP endpoints). The ratio of remote vs local MCP servers is shifting as managed platforms enter the ecosystem.

5. **Catalog now at 204+ servers.** Growth rate: ~28 new servers/day across all discovery sources. mcp.so is the fastest-turnaround listing platform; mcpservers.org has the deeper catalog. Both should be monitored.

## CorpusIQ Angle

The catalog now covers 204+ MCP servers - the most operator-focused collection available. New additions this sweep that are directly relevant:

- **FeatureBoard** is architecturally adjacent to CorpusIQ's multi-agent operations. Worth evaluating as a potential integration or partnership.
- **Confluence2MD** fills a gap for enterprise operators who live in Atlassian. Pairs with existing Atlassian MCP guide.
- **Reelier** addresses the compliance/audit requirement that enterprise operators increasingly need for AI agent operations.
