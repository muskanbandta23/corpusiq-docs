## Verification Notes

- Zetesis: initialize 200 no auth, serverInfo zetesis v1.28.1, tools evaluate_claim / zetesis_scope / zetesis_evidence / verify_attestation. Hard identifiers (PMID/DOI/NCT/grant) on every source, year-fenced retrieval.
- Hesper Atlas: initialize 200, 15 tools = 9 account-free evidence tools + 6 OAuth subscriber tools (signals:read scope). No raw market data, no trading.
- Done Bear: initialize 200, serverInfo donebear v0.7.0, 35 tools. Submission's GitHub link 404s (Nomos precedent: registry name + live endpoint beat repo availability).
- AdTest: single tool analyze_advert, 13 dimensions, async video flow, 1 credit per analysis, free account via app.adtest.ai.
- Layers: anonymous initialize returns 401 AUTH_REQUIRED (expected bearer-session gate); CLI setup writes .mcp.json + skill, session in OS credential store; every charge quoted, posting/spending/billing human-gated.
- Meridian QBO: GET /mcp returns 401 on anonymous probe (OAuth gate; /api/mcp 404s so /mcp is the endpoint). Free, multi-client, journal-entry writes. Pilot.com Inc.
- Pathwren: 7 tools captured; operator prefixes remirrored every 6 hours; 8 robots.txt stances; no vendor repo found.

## Skipped (not catalogued)

- Signadot (#3885) - ephemeral-environment Kubernetes sandboxes and traffic routing: dev infrastructure class.
- Aperture Wallet Knowledge (#3881) - official read-only product knowledge for a consumer crypto wallet: consumer product-docs class.
- Mantis Immersive Commerce (mcp.so recentServers) - showroom MCP whose core business tools are still mocked; the working surface is SDK codegen utilities: premature per the Krimskrams rule.
- Novu (mcp.so recentServers) - notification infrastructure: dev infra class.
- Backblaze B2 (mcp.so recentServers) - cloud storage operations: cloud infra class.
- ComputeSage StackBench (mcpservers.org homepage) - GPU/LLM benchmarks and hardware recommendations: dev infrastructure class.
- AmanChain x402 Marketplace (mcpservers.org homepage) - crypto agent-to-agent payment marketplace: x402 plumbing class.
- Sauna Guide Quotes (/all) - consumer home-sauna project briefs and quote requests: consumer niche class.
- mcpservers.org /all page 1 repeats and homepage slugs: all prior-sweep dispositions (CordFind, Vaanzari, Firefly III, Onchain Diary, SigVest, GridCarbon, urdigitalau family incl. WordPress/Clarity/Bing Webmaster/Cloudflare, Seedance, Wan 3.0, local-gpu-imagegen, LinkUpAPI, chat-recall, Perception, GridNews, mlab.sh, IMS Creators, DAST flight data, Symvanta, 3D-Agent, famous-name re-indexes; Atomic Mail, CarChat, file2markdown, BiGapi repeats).

## Trends

- Verification-first submissions continue: three of six fresh issues shipped citation-ready, read-only, no-auth or narrow-scope surfaces with published registry records (Zetesis, Hesper, Done Bear, Aperture) - the "evidence and provenance" pattern from Edgrapi/Trooth/VulX Watch is consolidating into a product class.
- Accounting and AEO both surfaced from directory homepages this sweep (Meridian QBO, AI Crawler Index), confirming homepage slug cross-refs still produce the catch-up yield the /all page no longer does.
- The human-in-the-loop growth server pattern (Layers: quoted charges, human-gated posting/spending) is the same governance shape ErzyCall brought to voice - approval-gated autonomous execution is becoming the standard architecture for commercial agent servers.

## Actions Taken

- 7 integration guides written to hermes/mcp/servers/external/<slug>/index.md
- index.md updated: top sweep section, last-updated line, docs-links tail block
- validate-guides.py: 7/7 PASS; See Also dir + label checks run; seomely label corrected to index label
- Committed and pushed to main with full-hash verification
