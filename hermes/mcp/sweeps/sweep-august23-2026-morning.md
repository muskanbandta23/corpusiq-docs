- **DotLy ID** (mcpservers.org homepage) - biolink and domain-registration vendor. Endpoint mcp.dotly.id/mcp not probeable (HTTP error on initialize), thin niche surface, Registly class.
- **Hypnothera** (mcp.so homepage) - personalized hypnosis sessions from what the assistant knows about the user. Consumer wellness; Jul 17 listing (catch-up noise).

## Notes

- All 4 catalogued servers were live-probed before guide writing (probe is ground truth for tool counts): FluentEDI exposed 17 tools vs 36 claimed in the issue (tool_call dispatcher covers the rest); Kirah returned all 10 tools on kirah-agent-gateway v2.16; Truth Bear returned 3 tools on truthbear-gauge v1.0.0 with free-tool + x402 paid-record model confirmed by the server's initialize instructions.
- FluentEDI repo (mastermanas805/fluentedi-mcp) is brand new: created Aug 23, 2026, 0 stars, no license declared in README - guide notes this for enterprise embedding caution.
- Domain MCP npm package verified published (v2.0.0, created Dec 5 2025) before cataloguing, per the npm-unpublished skip rule.
- Truth Bear is a catch-up (mcp.so listing Aug 14) that carried real business data - catalogued per the "catalogue regardless of age when it carries real business data" rule and the x402 business-data test (RE Data Refinery / SYNTHORA precedent).
- Catalog index updated: 321 to 325 servers (+207 to +211 guides).
