## Notes

- Same-name different-vendor: GSC (ni-c) catalogued alongside yusofansari's read-only GSC server; distinct slug google-search-console-ni-c-mcp, differentiated on write-side setup (Site Verification + Indexing APIs).
- HasData family pages (google-maps, flights, trends, search, etc.) already disposed in prior sweeps.
- YNAB MCP and PersonaCLI were previously skip-prosed (July 27 evening, Aug 29 morning respectively) - not re-evaluated.
- Insourcia and PreVibe Tools tables are capability-level with caveat lines (anonymous enumeration not published); PolicyForge/Equibles/Apple Ads/GSC/CRM Solid/healthchecks/AngelOne tool names from vendor docs.
