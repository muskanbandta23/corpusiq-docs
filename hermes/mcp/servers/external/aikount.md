## Use Cases for Business Operators

### 1. Automated Invoice Processing
Have your AI agent handle invoice creation end-to-end:

```
Agent prompt: "Issue an invoice to ClienteTech SL (NIF B12345678) 
for our consulting work in June: 40 hours at €85/hour. 
Apply 21% IVA and 15% IRPF withholding. Email to administracion@clientetech.es."
```

### 2. Expense PDF OCR
Process a stack of expense receipts automatically:

```
Agent prompt: "OCR these 12 expense PDFs from my June purchases. 
Categorize them, extract IVA amounts, flag any that are 
non-deductible, and add them to my Q2 expenses."
```

### 3. Bank Reconciliation
Close the month by reconciling bank movements:

```
Agent prompt: "Here's my June bank statement CSV from BBVA. 
Reconcile all movements against my June invoices and expenses. 
Flag any unmatched transactions for manual review."
```

### 4. Quarterly VAT Return (Modelo 303)
Prepare the quarterly IVA filing:

```
Agent prompt: "Prepare my Q2 2026 Modelo 303. 
Calculate IVA repercutido from all issued invoices, 
IVA soportado from all captured expenses, 
apply prorrata if applicable, and show the net result 
(a pagar or a devolver)."
```

## Integration with CorpusIQ

Aikount + CorpusIQ = complete Spanish business operations:

1. **CorpusIQ Stripe connector** → pull payment data for invoice matching
2. **CorpusIQ email connector** → find supplier invoices for expense capture
3. **AI agent** → reconcile Stripe payouts against Aikount invoices

This gives Spanish-market operators an AI-native accounting stack from sales to tax filing.
