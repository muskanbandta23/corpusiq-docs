# Confluent MCP - Apache Kafka for AI Agents

## What It Is

Confluent MCP exposes Apache Kafka data streaming capabilities over the Model Context Protocol. AI agents can manage topics, monitor consumer groups, interact with Schema Registry, and oversee Connect pipelines - making Kafka's event-driven infrastructure accessible through natural language.

## Tools Available

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Topic management | List, create, describe, and configure Kafka topics |
| Consumer group monitoring | Track offsets, lag, and member status |
| Schema Registry | Manage Avro/Protobuf/JSON schemas |
| Connect management | Monitor and manage Kafka Connect connectors |

## Quick Start

```bash
npx -y @confluentinc/mcp-confluent
```

## Business Use Cases

1. Monitor data pipeline health: "Show consumer lag across all production topics"
2. Topic inventory: "List all Kafka topics and their partition counts"
3. Schema lookup: "What's the latest schema version for the orders topic?"

## Limitations

- Confluent Cloud or self-managed Kafka cluster required. Read-heavy; topic creation possible with elevated permissions.
