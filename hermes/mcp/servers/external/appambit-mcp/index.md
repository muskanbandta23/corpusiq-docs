# AppAmbit MCP - Integration Guide

**Provider:** AppAmbit
**GitHub:** 10 stars
**Category:** AI & Agents - Mobile Development Platform
**Listing:** mcp.so (July 13, 2026)

## Overview

AppAmbit MCP connects AI agents to the AppAmbit platform - an all-in-one solution for mobile app development and operations. It covers the full mobile lifecycle: analytics, crash reporting, build distribution, managed databases, serverless functions, and CMS.

## Why This Matters for Operators

- **Full mobile lifecycle:** One MCP server covers analytics, crash reporting, builds, databases, serverless, and content - reducing tool sprawl
- **AI-driven mobile ops:** Operators can query app performance, investigate crashes, trigger builds, and manage content entirely through AI agent conversations
- **10 GitHub stars:** Early but gaining traction in the mobile dev community
- **First comprehensive mobile MCP:** Most MCP servers target web/SaaS - AppAmbit is the first to cover the entire mobile development stack

## Installation

```bash
npx -y @appambit/mcp-server
```

Or add to MCP client configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "appambit": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@appambit/mcp-server"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Available Tools

*Categories confirmed from the mcp.so listing - full tool list to be confirmed from AppAmbit documentation:*

| Domain | Capabilities |
|--------|-------------|
| **Analytics** | User metrics, retention, funnel analysis, revenue tracking |
| **Crash Reporting** | Crash logs, stack traces, affected users, regression detection |
| **Build Distribution** | Build uploads, version management, tester distribution |
| **Managed Databases** | Query execution, schema management, data exploration |
| **Serverless Functions** | Function deployment, invocation logs, performance metrics |
| **CMS** | Content management, media uploads, localization |

## Use Cases

1. **Mobile App Operators:** Query app analytics and crash data directly from AI agents without switching dashboards
2. **Release Management:** Trigger builds, distribute to testers, and monitor crash rates post-release - all from AI workflows
3. **Content Teams:** Manage app content (CMS) through AI agents for rapid updates
4. **DevOps:** Monitor serverless function performance and database health from AI-driven dashboards

## Complementary to CorpusIQ

CorpusIQ provides business-level data (revenue, customers, marketing). AppAmbit provides the mobile product-level data (analytics, crashes, builds). Together they give operators a complete view - from business metrics to product health - all accessible through AI agents.

## Status

⚠️ **New listing (July 13, 2026)** - 10 GitHub stars, active development. Strong value proposition for mobile-first operators. Monitor for API stability before production deployment.
