## Why This Matters for Operators

Public procurement is a market most vendors ignore because the data is scattered and the language of each jurisdiction is hostile. ToBid's engine turns Taiwan's tender records into operator questions: who keeps winning this agency's work, what does the agency spend, which cases repeatedly fail and sit open (hot opportunities for new entrants), and what price should I actually bid. The live probe confirmed the surface: server `tobid v1.29.1`, all 8 tools enumerated anonymously.

**The price engine is the differentiator.** `price_analysis` returns three bid tiers (conservative / typical / aggressive) computed from historical award-to-budget ratios, choosing its comparison base by sample adequacy: similar cases by title keywords, then same agency, then same category, then the whole database.

## Tools & Capabilities

| Tool | What it does |
|---|---|
| `search_tenders` | Keyword search over title and agency name; filter tender / awarded / failed |
| `get_tender` | Full case history: every announcement, budget, award amount, winning vendor, competition (bidder count, single-bid flags), renewal status |
| `price_analysis` | Three-tier bid price suggestion from award-to-budget history |
| `vendor_report` | Win rate, known award totals, biggest client, single-bid share, frequent opponents and relative win rates, recent wins and losses |
| `unit_report` | Agency issuance scale, top suppliers, supplier concentration, competition level, busy months, recurring-cycle cases with predicted next issue dates |
| `compare_vendors` | Head-to-head record between two vendors |
| `hot_opportunities` | Repeatedly failed, still-open cases - low competition entry points (latest 10) |
| `find_entity` | Resolve partial names to official agency/vendor names and codes |

## Installation

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http tobid https://api.tobid.tw/mcp
```

No key, no account. Works in any Streamable HTTP MCP client; setup guides (in Traditional Chinese) are at tobid.tw/guide/mcp.

## Configuration

None. The endpoint is public and free by design.

## Business Relevance

Suppliers bidding into Taiwan government contracts - from air conditioning to smart streetlights - get win-rate and price intelligence without building a data pipeline. International operators entering the market get agency spending maps and a vendor landscape in chat. Procurement researchers get the single-bid share metric (library-wide average 50.1%) that flags where competition is thin.

## Integration with CorpusIQ

CorpusIQ's read-only business connectors cover a company's own financials and operations. ToBid adds the public-sector demand side: an agent preparing a market entry or a bid strategy can pair CorpusIQ's internal margin data with ToBid's award-price benchmarks and competitor win rates to set a bid that is both profitable and winnable.

## Limitations

- Taiwan procurement only; interface language is Traditional Chinese (tool descriptions are Chinese)
- Award-to-budget ratio benchmarks depend on sample sufficiency in the category
- No alerting or saved searches in the current tool surface
