## What It Does

Crustdata is a B2B intelligence layer for AI agents. Instead of manually searching LinkedIn, crunchbase, job boards, and company databases, your AI agent queries Crustdata over MCP and gets structured results from all sources simultaneously. Set up watchers that monitor target accounts and people for changes - new job posts, leadership moves, funding events, and social signals.

## Key Capabilities

- **Company Search** - Find and enrich company profiles with firmographics, funding, and news
- **People Search** - Find and enrich contact profiles with role, history, and social presence
- **Job Intelligence** - Search job postings, track hiring patterns, identify growth signals
- **Social Monitoring** - Track social posts and presence for companies and key people
- **Watchers** - Set up persistent monitors that alert on changes to target accounts/people
- **15+ Data Sources** - Aggregated from public and licensed B2B data providers

## Installation
