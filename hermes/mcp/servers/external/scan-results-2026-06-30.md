- **AI agent search optimization**: NotHumanSearch + Geoly show that "agentic SEO" is becoming its own category - operators need to optimize for AI agent discovery, not just human search
- **MCP security layer forming**: Agent Warden + MCPscan show security infrastructure for MCP is maturing - audit proxies, supply chain scanning, policy enforcement
- **Universal gateways consolidating**: APIbase (905 tools, 1 endpoint) signals MCP gateway consolidation trend
- **Real-time decision intelligence**: Sparkient (sub-100ms) shows MCP moving into latency-sensitive decision workflows
