# The Bot Wire MCP - Primary-Source Regulatory & Economic Intelligence

**Rating:** ★★★ | **Category:** Finance & Compliance | **Transport:** Streamable HTTP

## What It Does

The Bot Wire provides 40 real-time primary-source data wires covering SEC EDGAR filings, Federal Register rules, federal court opinions (Supreme Court, 2nd/9th/Federal Circuits), congressional bills, SEC/FTC enforcement actions, DOJ announcements, FDA approvals, Federal Reserve/FOMC statements, ECB policy releases, BLS/BEA economic releases, CISA CVEs, and cloud provider status. Unlike news aggregators, Bot Wire reads original documents directly - your AI agent answers questions about post-cutoff events with actual primary-source citations.

## Why Business Operators Need This

Compliance officers, financial analysts, competitive intelligence teams, and legal researchers spend hours manually monitoring regulatory sources. The Bot Wire automates this: your agent can answer "What did the Federal Reserve say about rates this week?" or "Are there new SEC filings from our top 3 competitors?" with original-source citations - no news summaries, no middle layers. For operators in regulated industries (fintech, healthcare, defense, energy), this is the difference between being informed and being blindsided. First MCP to read regulatory/legal/economic primary sources directly.

## Verdict: ★★★ - Essential for Compliance & Regulatory Operators

The Bot Wire is the first MCP server that brings primary-source regulatory, legal, and economic data to AI agents. For any operator in regulated industries or anyone who needs to answer questions with original-source citations post-training-cutoff, this is a category-defining tool. The breadth - 40 wires spanning SEC to CISA to cloud status - makes it a single integration for regulatory awareness.

**Strengths:** 40 primary-source wires across regulatory/legal/economic/compliance domains, reads original documents directly (not news coverage), free tier, remote HTTP endpoint, simple setup.

**Limitations:** Brand new (0 stars, created July 27, 2026), free tier rate limits unknown, historical data depth unclear, wire polling frequency not documented.

**Best for:** Compliance officers, financial analysts, legal researchers, competitive intelligence teams, operators in regulated industries (fintech, healthcare, defense, energy).
