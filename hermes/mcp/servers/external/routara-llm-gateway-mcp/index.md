# Routara LLM Gateway MCP Server

MCP server providing an **OpenAI-compatible gateway to 787+ chat, image, and video models**. Single endpoint for multi-model access - drop it into any MCP client and route requests across providers without changing client code.

## What It Does

- **Unified Model Access** - 787+ models behind one OpenAI-compatible API
- **Automatic Routing** - Route requests based on cost, latency, or capability requirements
- **Multi-Modal** - Chat, image generation, and video models in one gateway
- **MCP-Native** - Designed specifically as an MCP server, not just an API proxy

## Business Operator Use Cases

| Use Case | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Cost Optimization** | Route simple queries to cheap models, complex analysis to premium ones |
| **Provider Redundancy** | "If OpenAI is down, fall back to Anthropic automatically" |
| **Model Comparison** | Test the same prompt across 5 models simultaneously |
| **Single Integration Point** | One MCP config instead of managing 10+ separate server entries |

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/36412749-collab/routara-mcp
cd routara-mcp
npm install
```

## Configuration

Add to your MCP client config:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "routara": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["path/to/routara-mcp/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "ROUTARA_API_KEY": "your-api-key",
        "ROUTARA_BASE_URL": "https://api.routara.io"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Tools Provided

- `chat_completion` - OpenAI-compatible chat with model selection
- `list_models` - Query available models with pricing and capability metadata
- `compare_models` - Run same prompt across multiple models, compare output
- `set_routing_policy` - Configure cost/latency/quality routing rules

## Limitations

- **0 stars, brand new** - Created July 20, 2026. Unvetted.
- **Routara SaaS dependency** - Requires a Routara account and API key. Adds another vendor.
- **Pricing unknown** - No public pricing for the gateway service itself (on top of underlying model costs).
- **Latency overhead** - Additional hop through the gateway adds latency vs direct provider access.

## Operator Verdict

★★ **Useful for multi-model operations but adds vendor dependency.** For operators running 5+ models across multiple providers, this simplifies MCP configuration significantly. However, the trade-off is routing all model traffic through Routara's infrastructure. Compare against direct MCP server configurations before adopting.
