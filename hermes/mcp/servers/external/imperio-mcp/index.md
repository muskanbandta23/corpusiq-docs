# Imperio MCP

**Remote MCP server (Streamable HTTP, JSON-RPC 2.0, stateless)** - Imperio exposes verified Italian tax and compliance tooling to AI agents: Codice Fiscale, P.IVA, IBAN, ATECO, IVA (with reverse charge and split payment), IMU, the forfettario flat-rate regime, F24 lines, FatturaPA/SDI parsing, INTRASTAT, NIS2 scope, and anti-fraud payee verification with live VIES. Every result comes from official algorithms and tables - no LLM inference touches the numbers. Registered as `com.imperioutils/fisco-it`.

```
Server type: Remote (Streamable HTTP, JSON-RPC 2.0, stateless)

## Why This Matters for Operators

Italian tax identifiers are check-digit-encoded, which means they are deterministic - computable - yet most tools either ship them through an LLM (with hallucination risk) or leave you copying numbers into government calculators. Imperio does neither.

**Determinism is the differentiator**: official algorithms and tables produce the result, so a Codice Fiscale validation or an IVA calculation is a computation, not a guess. The two tools with live external I/O (VIES) degrade honestly when VIES is down. For any operator with Italian counterparties - clients, suppliers, contractors - the checks become tool calls with the legal article cited for every step.

## Tools & Capabilities

| Area | Purpose |
|---|---|
| Identifiers | Codice Fiscale, P.IVA, IBAN, PEC validation |
| Classification | ATECO ISTAT activity codes |
| VAT | IVA calculation incl. reverse charge and split payment |
| Property & regime | IMU property tax, forfettario flat-rate regime |
| Filing formats | F24 lines, FatturaPA/SDI parsing, INTRASTAT |
| Compliance scope | NIS2 scope under Italian Legislative Decree 138/2024 |
| Anti-fraud | Payee verification with live VIES; supplier-guardian tools (free account + API key) |

## Installation

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http imperio-fisco https://imperioutils.com/api/mcp
```

Methods: `initialize`, `tools/list`, `tools/call`. Anonymous calls are rate-limited per IP; the tax tools need no login and consume no credits.

## Configuration

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "imperio-fisco": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://imperioutils.com/api/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

## Business Relevance

- **Finance teams with Italian operations** get FatturaPA parsing and IVA calculations that match the official tables exactly.
- **Founders registering in Italy** get P.IVA, Codice Fiscale, and ATECO validation before filings go in.
- **Procurement teams** get anti-fraud payee verification with live VIES before paying a new Italian supplier.
- **Compliance leads** get NIS2 scope answers with the article cited, free, in beta.

## Integration with CorpusIQ

Imperio extends the EU accounting path CorpusIQ already covers - Axonaut for French operations and QuickBooks for the general ledger. An operator paying Italian suppliers can validate IBANs and screen payees through Imperio before recording the bill in QuickBooks or Axonaut, and can parse incoming FatturaPA XML into structured invoice data for the ledger. The deterministic-algorithm design matches CorpusIQ's data accuracy contract: computed, verifiable, and free of inference.

## Limitations

- Brand new - no track record yet; listing appeared August 17, 2026.
- Italy only - no other jurisdictions.
- Beta platform; paid plans are not purchasable until 2027 (everything current is free).
- Anonymous calls are IP rate-limited; supplier-guardian tools need a free account and API key.
- Italian-language documentation (English summary provided on the docs page).
