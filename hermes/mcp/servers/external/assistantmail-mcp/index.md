# AssistantMail MCP - Managed Mailboxes for AI Agents

**MCP server (stdio via npx, hosted mailbox backend)** - gives AI agents a managed mailbox to send and receive email, built for personal and small-team OpenClaw and Hermes operators who want agent email with allowlists, consent, retention rules and spend caps they control. Agents get a real inbox without raw SMTP access, and every message routes through guardrails the operator configures. Listed on ClawHub for easy install.

```
Server type: stdio (npx) with hosted mailbox backend
Auth: API key (ASSISTANT_MAIL_API_KEY, amk_ prefix)
Endpoint: npx -y @assistantmail/assistantmail-mcp
Tools: mailbox send, receive and management (served from the package)
Pricing: free tier - 1 agent, 25 messages/day - paid plans above
Category: Communication & Email
Built by: AssistantMail (assistant-mail.ai)
```

## Why This Matters for Operators

Autonomous agents that email on their own behalf are exactly as dangerous as they are useful: one hallucinated reply to a customer, or one unfiltered outbound blast, and the domain reputation is gone. AssistantMail's answer is a managed mailbox layer where the operator configures the guardrails once - who the agent may write to (allowlist), what consent applies, how long mail is retained and how much the agent can spend - and the agent never touches SMTP directly.

**The guardrails are the product: allowlist, consent, retention and spend caps are first-class settings rather than afterthoughts, so the operator's policy travels with the mailbox instead of living in the agent's prompt.** For OpenClaw and Hermes operators specifically, the install is one ClawHub command (`openclaw skills install @assistantmail/assistant-mail`) or one npx invocation, and the free tier (1 agent, 25 messages/day) is enough to evaluate the whole flow before paying.

The positioning is deliberate - agent email with controls - and the same MCP package works across Claude Desktop, Cursor, OpenClaw and Hermes, so one mailbox policy covers every harness.

## Tools & Capabilities

| Capability | What an agent can do |
|---|---|
| Send | Send email from the managed mailbox under the configured allowlist and spend caps |
| Receive | Read inbound messages with retention rules applied |
| Mailbox management | Manage the mailbox surface (threads, folders) through MCP tools |
| Policy enforcement | Every operation resolves against operator-set allowlist, consent, retention and spend settings |

The full tool list is served from the npm package once installed; the table above follows the vendor's published description. The API key is minted in the AssistantMail app and shown only once at creation.

## Installation

```bash
npx -y @assistantmail/assistantmail-mcp
```

Or on OpenClaw:

```bash
openclaw skills install @assistantmail/assistant-mail
```

Create a free account, generate an API key in the app (shown once - copy it immediately), and set it in the environment for your MCP client. Requires Node 24+.

## Configuration

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "assistantmail": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@assistantmail/assistantmail-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "ASSISTANT_MAIL_API_KEY": "amk_your_key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The same key works across clients. Policy settings (allowlist, consent, retention, spend caps) live in the AssistantMail app, not in client config, so the operator controls them from one place.

## Business Relevance

- **Autonomous agent operators** get agent email with spend caps and allowlists instead of raw SMTP credentials
- **OpenClaw and Hermes users** get a one-command install and one policy surface across harnesses
- **Small teams** keep consent and retention rules uniform across every agent mailbox
- **Domain-reputation owners** bound outbound volume and destinations before the first send

## Integration with CorpusIQ

AssistantMail complements CorpusIQ's media@ and info@ email handling by giving autonomous agents their own managed mailbox under operator guardrails. CorpusIQ's inbound email connectors read the business inboxes with the operator's rules; AssistantMail gives agents a separate, policy-bound surface for outbound sequences and automated replies, so agent mail never mixes with the company's primary reputation. A composed workflow: CorpusIQ identifies a lead worth following up through its CRM and enrichment connectors, and the agent drafts the follow-up through AssistantMail under the configured allowlist and spend caps, with consent and retention policy enforced by the mailbox layer itself.

## Limitations

- New listing (September 2026) - young product, small track record
- Free tier is thin (1 agent, 25 messages/day) and intended for evaluation
- stdio transport via npx - no hosted remote endpoint published
- Guardrail enforcement depends on the operator actually configuring the policy settings
- Email delivery reputation ultimately sits with the AssistantMail infrastructure
