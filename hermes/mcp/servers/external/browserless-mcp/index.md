# Browserless MCP

Official MCP server from Browserless - the leading headless Chrome SaaS used by Apify, n8n, and thousands of operators. AI agents describe what they want in natural language and Browserless executes it on production-grade Chrome infrastructure.

## What It Does

- **Navigate:** Browse any website with full JavaScript rendering
- **Scrape:** Extract structured data from any page (tables, text, prices, listings)
- **Screenshot:** Capture full-page or element-specific screenshots
- **PDF Generation:** Convert any web page to PDF
- **Form Interaction:** Fill forms, click buttons, submit data
- **Performance:** Get Core Web Vitals, Lighthouse scores, and page speed metrics

## Why It Matters for Operators

Browserless is already the production standard for headless Chrome at scale. This MCP removes the final barrier - instead of writing Playwright scripts:
```
Agent: "Go to competitor.com/pricing, find their enterprise plan price, and tell me if it changed since last week"
→ Browserless navigates → extracts pricing table → compares to stored value → reports delta
```

No more `page.goto()`, `page.waitForSelector()`, or CSS selector debugging. The AI agent handles the intent; Browserless handles the browser.

## Setup

### Prerequisites
- Browserless account ([browserless.io](https://www.browserless.io))
- API token (Dashboard → API Keys)
- Or self-host Browserless (open source, Docker image)

### Claude Desktop
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "browserless": {
      "type": "streamable-http",
      "url": "https://chrome.browserless.io/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_BROWSERLESS_TOKEN"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Self-Hosted
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "browserless": {
      "type": "streamable-http",
      "url": "http://localhost:3000/mcp",
      "headers": {}
    }
  }
}
```

### Hermes Agent
```yaml
mcp_servers:
  browserless:
    type: streamable-http
    url: "https://chrome.browserless.io/mcp"
    headers:
      Authorization: "Bearer ${BROWSERLESS_TOKEN}"
```

Self-hosted: Free (open source, Docker: `docker run -p 3000:3000 browserless/chrome`)

## Use Cases

### Competitive Price Monitoring
```
Agent: "Every Monday at 8 AM, scrape the pricing pages of our top 5 competitors and alert me if anything changed"
→ navigate to each → extract pricing → diff against baseline → alert
```

### SEO & Content Audits
```
Agent: "Check our top 20 landing pages for Core Web Vitals issues and list the 10 slowest"
→ navigate → performance for each → sort by LCP → report
```

### Form Automation
```
Agent: "Register us for this industry conference - my email is [x], use the early bird code"
→ navigate to registration → type form fields → click submit → screenshot confirmation
```

### Data Extraction at Scale
```
Agent: "From this list of 100 company URLs, extract the CEO name and contact email from each"
→ batch_navigate → scrape contact pages → extract email patterns → return CSV
```

### Visual Regression Testing
```
Agent: "Take screenshots of our checkout flow on mobile and desktop and compare to last week's baseline"
→ navigate to checkout → screenshot(mobile) → screenshot(desktop) → diff against baseline
```

## Self-Hosting

Browserless is open source. For operators who want full control:

```bash
docker run -d \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  -e "CONCURRENT=10" \
  -e "TOKEN=your-secret-token" \
  -e "MAX_QUEUE_LENGTH=100" \
  browserless/chrome:latest
```

Then point the MCP at `http://localhost:3000/mcp`.

Self-hosted benefits:
- No session limits (bounded only by your hardware)
- No third-party data exposure
- Custom Chrome flags and extensions
- VPN/geo-targeted browsing

## Limitations

- **JavaScript-heavy sites:** Some SPAs may require `wait_for` or explicit delays. The MCP handles most cases but extremely dynamic pages may need scripted approaches.
- **CAPTCHA:** Browserless does not solve CAPTCHAs. For sites with CAPTCHA gates, use the LinkedIn MCP's managed infrastructure or similar solutions.
- **Session limits:** Free tier is generous (1,000 sessions) but high-frequency scraping requires a paid plan.
- **Concurrency:** Cloud plans have concurrency caps - large batch jobs queue automatically.
