# Feedback Synthesis MCP

**Source:** mcp.so submission #3282 (July 23, 2026) · GitHub: [sapph1re/feedback-synthesis-mcp](https://github.com/sapph1re/feedback-synthesis-mcp)

## What It Does

Customer feedback intelligence MCP server that aggregates product feedback from multiple sources - GitHub Issues, Hacker News, App Store reviews - and synthesizes them into ranked pain clusters. Identifies recurring themes and actionable insights for product teams.

**Key capabilities:**
- Aggregate feedback across GitHub Issues, HN threads, App Store reviews
- Rank pain clusters by frequency, severity, and trend
- Identify recurring themes for roadmap prioritization
- Pay-per-call via x402 micropayments (USDC on Base) - no subscription

## Relevance to Operators

Directly useful for product managers and operators who need to:
- Prioritize bug fixes and feature requests from scattered feedback sources
- Detect emerging pain points before they become churn drivers
- Quantify user sentiment across multiple channels
- Build data-driven roadmaps without manual feedback triage

**Rating:** ★★ - Early stage (0 GitHub stars, created April 2026), but directly addresses a universal operator problem. x402 payment model may limit adoption.

## Quick Integration

**Transport:** Streamable HTTP (remote endpoint)  
**Auth:** x402 micropayments (USDC on Base)  
**Pricing:** Pay-per-call, no subscription  

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "feedback-synthesis": {
      "url": "https://feedback-synthesis-mcp.example.com/mcp",
      "transport": "streamable-http"
    }
  }
}
```

## Use Cases

1. **Product Roadmap:** Aggregate GitHub Issues + App Store reviews → ranked pain clusters for sprint planning
2. **Community Health:** Monitor HN discussions for sentiment shifts on your product
3. **Competitive Intel:** Feed competitor app store reviews to identify their weaknesses

## Caveats

- Zero GitHub stars, early-stage project - expect API changes
- x402 micropayments require USDC on Base wallet setup
- Limited to text-based feedback sources (no social media scraping yet)
- No authentication beyond x402 payment verification
