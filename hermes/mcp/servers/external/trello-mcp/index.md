# Trello MCP Server

**Provider:** Atlassian (Official)
**Endpoint:** `https://mcp.trello.com/v1`
**Auth:** OAuth 2.0
**Transport:** Streamable HTTP
**License:** Apache 2.0
**Status:** Available (Beta)
**Repository:** [github.com/atlassian/trello-mcp-server](https://github.com/atlassian/trello-mcp-server)

## Overview

The official Trello MCP server is a cloud-hosted bridge between your Trello account and any MCP-compatible AI assistant. Once connected, AI tools can read boards, lists, cards, and checklists - and take actions on your behalf based on the permissions you grant.

Atlassian now offers official MCP servers across their entire product suite: Jira, Confluence, and Trello. This makes MCP the standard integration layer for Atlassian's AI ecosystem.

## What You Can Do

- **Read boards, lists, cards** - Query Trello content from AI assistants
- **Create and update cards** - Manage tasks without switching apps
- **Manage checklists** - Add, update, and complete checklist items
- **Search across workspaces** - Find cards and boards by keyword
- **Archive (no delete)** - Cards and lists can be archived but not permanently deleted
- **Workspace-scoped access** - Each connection authorizes one workspace (multi-workspace planned)

## Use Cases for Business Operators

1. **Daily standup automation:** Ask your AI assistant "What's on my Trello board today?" and get a prioritized task list.
2. **Cross-tool workflows:** Connect Trello tasks to Slack alerts, email summaries, or GitHub issues through your AI agent.
3. **Project reporting:** Query Trello for project status, blocked cards, and upcoming deadlines - all from chat.
4. **Bulk operations:** Update multiple cards, reorder lists, or assign tasks without clicking through the Trello UI.

## Before You Connect

- A Trello account (any plan works - Free, Standard, Premium, or Enterprise)
- Access to a supported MCP client
- A modern browser for the OAuth authorization flow

## Setup

### Option 1: Claude (Desktop or claude.ai)

1. Open Claude → **Settings** → **Connectors**
2. Click **Add** → **Add custom connector**
3. Fill in:
   - **Name:** Trello
   - **URL:** `https://mcp.trello.com/v1`
4. Click **Add**, then click **Connect**
5. In the browser popup, choose your Trello workspace and review permissions
6. Click **Authorize**

Alternatively, install from the [Claude connector directory](https://claude.ai/directory/connectors/trello).

### Option 2: ChatGPT

Install directly from the [ChatGPT Trello listing](https://chatgpt.com/apps/trello/asdk_app_6a20b18a639081918c1b438f8381b27e).

### Option 3: Cursor

Add to `~/.cursor/mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "trello": {
      "url": "https://mcp.trello.com/v1"
    }
  }
}
```

Then go to **Customize** → **MCPs** → click **Authenticate** on the Trello server.

### Option 4: VS Code / GitHub Copilot

Add to your MCP configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "trello": {
      "url": "https://mcp.trello.com/v1"
    }
  }
}
```

### Option 5: Gemini CLI

Refer to the [Gemini CLI MCP documentation](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/blob/main/docs/tools/mcp-server.md) and add the Trello endpoint.

## Security Model

- **OAuth 2.0** - Industry-standard authentication
- **Workspace-scoped** - AI tools only access the workspace you explicitly authorize
- **Permission-respecting** - All actions respect your existing Trello permissions; AI can't do anything you can't
- **No destructive deletes** - Cards and lists can be archived, never permanently deleted
- **Revocable** - Disconnect at any time from Trello or your AI client settings

## Limitations

- **Single workspace per connection** - Each MCP connection supports one Trello workspace. Multi-workspace is planned.
- **No permanent delete** - Archive-only for safety. Manual deletion still available in Trello directly.
- **Beta status** - The server is marked as beta; API surface may change.

## FAQ
