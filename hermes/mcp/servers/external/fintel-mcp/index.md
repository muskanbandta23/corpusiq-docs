# Fintel - Financial MCP Server

**Hosted financial data MCP server.** Connects AI agents to financial markets through a single Streamable HTTP endpoint. One of the newest hosted MCP servers, submitted directly to mcpservers.org on July 21, 2026.

## What It Does for Operators

- **Financial data access** - Real-time and historical market data through MCP tools
- **Streamable HTTP transport** - No local installation required. Connect your AI agent and start querying.
- **OAuth/API key auth** - Enterprise-grade authentication for financial data access
- **Hosted infrastructure** - No self-hosting, no maintenance. Fintel manages uptime and data quality.

## Installation

```bash
# No installation - hosted endpoint
# Connect directly via MCP client
```

## Claude Desktop / Hermes Config

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "fintel": {
      "type": "url",
      "url": "https://mcp.fintel.io"
    }
  }
}
```

## Key Tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Financial data queries | Real-time and historical market data |
| Market screening | Filter and screen financial instruments |

*Note: Full tool list unavailable without authentication. Register at mcp.fintel.io for complete API documentation.*

## Operator Use Cases

1. **Financial Analysts** - Query market data directly from AI agents without switching contexts
2. **Portfolio Managers** - Integrate market data into AI-powered investment workflows
3. **Business Operators** - Monitor market conditions affecting supply chains, FX exposure, and commodity costs

## CorpusIQ Angle

Fintel's hosted financial MCP complements CorpusIQ's business data connectors. Operators using CorpusIQ for operational data (QuickBooks, Stripe, Shopify) could layer Fintel for market context - commodity prices affecting COGS, FX rates affecting international revenue, interest rates affecting financing decisions.

## Limitations

- New server - limited community feedback and documentation
- Full tool list requires authentication
- Financial data licensing may restrict redistribution
- Category competes with established players (Alpha Vantage MCP, Bloomberg, etc.)
