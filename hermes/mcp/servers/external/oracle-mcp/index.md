# Oracle MCP Server (datagrout)

**First Oracle Fusion Cloud MCP server** - connects AI agents directly to Oracle's enterprise ERP platform through OAuth2. 1,000+ tools covering Financials, Procurement, Inventory, Suppliers, Tax, and Workforce.

> **Source:** [datagrout.ai/integrations/oracle-mcp-server](https://datagrout.ai/integrations/oracle-mcp-server)
> **Category:** Cloud Service / ERP
> **Transport:** Hosted remote (Streamable HTTP)
> **Auth:** OAuth 2.0
> **Pricing:** Datagrout platform pricing (check datagrout.ai for current plans)

## What It Does

The Oracle MCP Server exposes 1,000+ tools that let AI agents interact with Oracle Fusion Cloud:

- **Financials** - General ledger, payables, receivables, assets, cash management
- **Procurement** - Purchase orders, supplier agreements, requisitions, sourcing
- **Inventory** - Stock levels, item management, warehouses, transfers
- **Suppliers** - Supplier profiles, contracts, performance tracking
- **Tax** - Tax configurations, compliance reporting
- **Workforce** - HR data, organizational structures, headcount reporting

Write operations are **disabled by default** per integration - you enable them selectively. This follows the same security model as the datagrout QuickBooks MCP.

## Why This Matters for Operators

Oracle Fusion Cloud is one of the world's most deployed ERP systems, used by enterprises and mid-market companies globally. Before this, accessing Oracle data from AI agents required building custom REST/SOAP integrations or using expensive middleware like Boomi or MuleSoft.

Now your AI agent can:

- **"Pull open POs from Oracle Procurement and flag any past their delivery date"**
- **"Compare this quarter's GL actuals against budget by cost center"**
- **"Check inventory across all warehouses and suggest inter-warehouse transfers"**
- **"Generate a supplier spend report for the top 20 vendors this fiscal year"**
- **"Audit tax configurations for all legal entities with nexus in California"**

Any MCP-compatible AI client (Claude, Cursor, Codex, etc.) can now operate Oracle ERP data conversationally.

## How It Compares

| Feature | Oracle MCP (datagrout) | SAP MCPs (abapilot/capforge) | CorpusIQ (general) |
|---------|------------------------|------------------------------|--------------------|
| Tools | 1,000+ | ~30-50 (ABAP-focused) | 40+ (multi-source) |
| Platform | Oracle Fusion Cloud | SAP ECC / S/4HANA | 40+ platforms |
| Write support | ✅ (opt-in) | ✅ (ABAP native) | ❌ (read-only) |
| Auth | OAuth 2.0 | SAP-specific | OAuth 2.1 |
| Transport | Remote HTTP | Local/remote | Remote HTTP |
| Scope | Full Oracle Fusion | ABAP/CDS development | Multi-source BI |
| Maturity | New (July 2026) | Community/New | Production |

This is the first dedicated Oracle Fusion Cloud MCP. For SAP operators, see the abapilot and capforge MCPs for SAP ECC/S4HANA. For multi-source business intelligence across platforms, CorpusIQ remains the best choice.

## Integration Setup

### 1. Create a Datagrout Account

Sign up at [datagrout.ai](https://datagrout.ai) and navigate to Integrations → Oracle MCP Server.

### 2. Connect Oracle Fusion Cloud

Datagrout handles the Oracle OAuth flow. You'll authorize access to your Oracle Fusion Cloud instance with the specific modules (Financials, Procurement, etc.) you want the AI agent to access.

### 3. Configure Your MCP Client

Add the Oracle MCP endpoint to your AI client from the URL provided in your Datagrout dashboard.

**Claude Desktop (`claude_desktop_config.json`):**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "oracle": {
      "type": "url",
      "url": "https://datagrout.ai/mcp/oracle/YOUR_ENDPOINT",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_DATAGROUT_TOKEN"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Cursor / VS Code (`.cursor/mcp.json`):**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "oracle": {
      "url": "https://datagrout.ai/mcp/oracle/YOUR_ENDPOINT",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_DATAGROUT_TOKEN"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### 4. Select Modules

Oracle Fusion Cloud is modular. In your Datagrout dashboard, select which modules the AI agent can access:
- Financials
- Procurement
- Inventory
- Suppliers
- Tax
- Workforce

### 5. Enable Write Operations (Optional)

Write operations are disabled by default. To enable (e.g., allowing the AI agent to create purchase requisitions):

1. Datagrout dashboard → Integration Settings → Oracle
2. Toggle on specific write operations
3. Consider approval gates for high-value actions (POs, payments)

## Security Model

- **OAuth 2.0** with Oracle Fusion Cloud - scoped to your instance
- **Write operations disabled by default** - explicit opt-in per integration
- **Module-scoped** - you control exactly which Oracle modules are accessible
- **Per-tool audit** - every AI-initiated action is logged in Datagrout
- **Revocable** - disconnect from Datagrout or revoke the Oracle OAuth grant

## Limitations

- **Requires Datagrout platform** - not standalone
- **Oracle Fusion Cloud only** - no E-Business Suite, PeopleSoft, or JD Edwards support
- **New platform** - July 2026 launch
- **Write operations** require deliberate opt-in
- **Oracle licensing** may require specific API access tiers - verify with your Oracle rep
