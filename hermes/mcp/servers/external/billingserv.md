# BillingServ MCP - Billing & Invoicing Connector

## What It Is

BillingServ MCP (`BillingServ/MCP`) exposes the BillingServ billing platform API over the Model Context Protocol. AI agents can look up customers, retrieve invoices, check order statuses, and reconcile accounts - turning billing operations into conversational queries.

## Tools Available

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Customer lookup | Find customers by name, email, or ID |
| Invoice retrieval | Pull invoice details, status, and line items |
| Order search | Look up orders by status, customer, or date range |

## Quick Start

```bash
# Configuration via environment variables expected
npx -y @billingserv/mcp
```

## Business Use Cases

1. **AR reconciliation**: "Show all unpaid invoices over 60 days with customer contact info"
2. **Customer inquiry automation**: "What's the status of order #45219 for Acme Corp?"
3. **Monthly billing audit**: "List all invoices generated this month with totals and payment status"

## Limitations

- **BillingServ-specific**: Only works with BillingServ platform accounts
- **Early-stage**: Documentation and tool surface still evolving
- **No write-back**: Lookups only - no invoice creation or payment processing
