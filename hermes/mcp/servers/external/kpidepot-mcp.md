## Use Cases for Business Operators

### 1. Board Deck Data
Generate data-backed performance context:

```
Agent prompt: "I'm preparing our Q3 board deck. For our 5 core metrics
(CAC, LTV, churn, NPS, gross margin), pull SaaS industry benchmarks
for companies our size ($5-20M ARR). Show our actuals vs 50th and 75th
percentile. Format as a comparison table."
```

### 2. Investor Pitch Metrics
Validate your metrics against the market:

```
Agent prompt: "We pitch investors next week. Pull benchmarks for
B2B SaaS Series A companies: CAC payback period, net dollar retention,
gross margin, and magic number. Where do we need to improve to be
in the top quartile? What's table stakes for Series A?"
```

### 3. KPI Program Design
Design a measurement framework for a new initiative:

```
Agent prompt: "We're launching a customer success function. What are
the standard KPIs for B2B SaaS customer success? Pull the top 10 with
formulas and benchmarks. Recommend which 5 we should track first
and what good looks like at our stage."
```

### 4. Quarterly Business Review Prep
Automate QBR data preparation:

```
Agent prompt: "Pull benchmarks for all 12 KPIs in our Q3 scorecard.
For each, show: our Q3 actual, industry median, top quartile, and
our percentile rank. Flag any metric where we're below the 25th
percentile - those need a remediation plan."
```

## Integration with CorpusIQ

KPI Depot MCP + CorpusIQ = data-backed strategy execution:

1. **CorpusIQ GA4 connector** → pull your actual marketing metrics
2. **CorpusIQ Stripe connector** → pull your actual financial metrics
3. **KPI Depot MCP** → compare your actuals to industry benchmarks
4. **AI agent** → produce "where we stand" reports automatically

Your agent becomes a strategy analyst that doesn't just report your numbers - it tells you how your numbers compare to the market and what to do about it.

## Pricing
