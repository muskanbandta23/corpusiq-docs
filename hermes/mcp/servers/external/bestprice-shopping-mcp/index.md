# BestPrice Shopping MCP

**Remote MCP server (Streamable HTTP, keyless) for BestPrice.gr - product search, offer comparison, and price history for the Greek market.** Three read-only tools: search physical products across the reviewed BestPrice Greece catalog, compare current merchant offers delivered to a five-digit Greek postal code (shipping or delivered totals when available), and check whether today's price is low, typical, or high over 30, 90, or 180-day windows. The endpoint answered an anonymous live probe with serverInfo `bestprice-agent-commerce` v1.5.1 and exposed all three tools.

```
Server type: Remote (Streamable HTTP)
Auth: None
Endpoint: https://mcp.bestprice.gr/mcp
Tools: 3 (all read-only)
Pricing: Free, keyless
Category: Commerce & E-Commerce
Built by: TheBestCo / BestPrice.gr (registry gr.bestprice/mcp)
```

## Why This Matters for Operators

Greek e-commerce pricing intelligence normally means a person opening the BestPrice.gr site and comparing offers by hand, product by product. This endpoint lets an agent do that at scale: search the catalog, compare delivered totals across merchants for a specific postal code, and read the 30/90/180-day price history to judge whether a price is a deal or a trap. For retailers, distributors, and market analysts, that is competitive pricing data without a scraping project.

**The fail-closed design is notable.** Search is bounded to reviewed physical-goods categories; regulated or prohibited categories and catalog-dump requests fail closed. Results return signed BestPrice landing URLs rather than direct merchant URLs, so traffic attribution stays inside the platform.

## Tools & Capabilities

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `search_products` | Discovers physical products in the supported BestPrice Greece catalog, or looks up a known `product_id` |
| `compare_offers` | Compares current BestPrice offers for one grouped `product_id`, delivered to a five-digit Greek postal code, with shipping or delivered totals when available |
| `get_price_history` | Judges whether a product's current price is low, typical, or high over 30, 90, or 180-day windows |

## Installation

No auth, no install. Add the hosted endpoint to any MCP client:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "bestprice": {
      "url": "https://mcp.bestprice.gr/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

## Configuration

Nothing to configure - the endpoint is public and keyless. The server card is published at https://mcp.bestprice.gr/mcp/server-card. Privacy and terms live under www.bestprice.gr/policies/.

## Business Relevance

Three concrete operator use cases: a retailer checks where its own products price against competitors delivered to a customer's postal code; a buyer verifies whether a quote is high or low against 180 days of market history; an analyst tracks catalog price movement by category without building a scraper. The delivered-total comparison is the detail that matters in Greece, where shipping differences between mainland and islands regularly flip which merchant is actually cheapest.

## Integration with CorpusIQ

Complementary to CorpusIQ's commerce and analytics connectors: an agent can pull a brand's own sales and inventory context from CorpusIQ, then use BestPrice to read the Greek market's current offers and price history for the same categories. Both surfaces are read-only, and BestPrice's keyless design means no credential provisioning step before first use.

## Limitations

- Greek market only (`el-GR`), and search is bounded to reviewed physical-goods categories - regulated or prohibited categories fail closed.
- Price history windows are fixed at 30/90/180 days.
- Requires exact grouped `product_id` values for offer comparison and price history - discovery always starts with `search_products`.
- Repo is brand new (created Aug 26, 2026, 0 stars) and declares no license.
