## Overview

The **n8n MCP server** bridges n8n's workflow automation platform with AI models. It gives AI assistants structured access to n8n's complete node ecosystem - 2,175 nodes (827 core + 1,348 community) with documentation, properties, operations, and real-world examples. AI coding agents can now understand, recommend, and scaffold n8n workflows directly.

## Key Capabilities

| Resource | Coverage |
|----------|----------|
| **Core nodes** | 827 - full properties and operations |
| **Community nodes** | 1,348 (1,195 verified) - with source filters |
| **Node properties** | 99% coverage with detailed schemas |
| **Node operations** | 63.6% coverage of available actions |
| **Documentation** | 87% coverage from official n8n docs (including AI nodes) |
| **AI tools** | 265 AI-capable tool variants detected with full documentation |
| **Templates** | 2,352 workflow templates with 99.96% AI metadata coverage |
| **Real-world examples** | 156 ranked configurations from popular templates |

## What Agents Can Do

- **Discover nodes** - Search 2,175 nodes by name, category, or capability
- **Read documentation** - Get full node docs, properties, and input/output schemas
- **Recommend workflows** - Given a business requirement, suggest appropriate n8n nodes and template workflows
- **Validate configurations** - Check node parameters against their schemas before deployment
- **Scaffold workflows** - Generate n8n workflow JSON from natural language descriptions
- **Search templates** - Find matching templates for common automation patterns

## Integration

### 1. Claude Desktop

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "n8n": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["n8n-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. Hermes Agent (config.yaml)

```

### 3. Cursor / VS Code

Add to your MCP configuration file with the stdio transport using `npx n8n-mcp`.

## Business Operator Use Cases

1. **Workflow Discovery** - "What nodes can I use to connect my PostgreSQL database to Slack?" - agent finds the right nodes and shows wiring
2. **Automation Scaffolding** - "Build me a workflow that monitors Stripe for failed payments and posts to a Slack channel" - agent generates the workflow JSON
3. **Template Matching** - "I need to sync HubSpot deals to Google Sheets" - agent finds the closest template from 2,352 options
4. **Node Documentation Lookup** - "What parameters does the HTTP Request node accept for OAuth2?" - agent retrieves the complete schema
5. **AI Pipeline Design** - Agent recommends the 265 AI-capable nodes for building LLM-powered automation pipelines

## Pricing

- **n8n MCP server:** Free (open source, community-maintained)
- **n8n itself:** Free (self-hosted) or n8n Cloud from €20/month
- No API keys required for read-only documentation access
