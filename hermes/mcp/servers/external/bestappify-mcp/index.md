# BestAppify MCP

**The Shopify App Store, exposed to your AI client as 40 live tools.** BestAppify is an app-store intelligence platform for Shopify app developers; its MCP server puts the same data the dashboard renders behind tool calls - keyword rankings and history, competitor tracking, review intelligence, forum mentions, listing changes, revenue and churn - so an agent answers store questions from live data instead of guesses. A free plan (100 requests a day, no card) makes it usable the same day you connect.

```
Server type: Remote (Streamable HTTP)
Auth: Bearer API key
Endpoint: https://bestappify.app/api/mcp
Tools: 40 (rankings, competitors, reviews, revenue, niches)
Pricing: Free plan: 100 requests/day, no card; paid plans beyond
Category: E-commerce
Built by: BestAppify (bestappify.com)
```

## Why This Matters for Operators

Shopify app developers compete on store search exactly like e-commerce brands compete on Google - keyword rankings, review velocity and listing changes decide installs. **BestAppify turns that into tool calls**: "which of my keywords lost ground this week and which app took the spot", "summarize every 1-star review from the last month", "did a competitor change their pricing or tagline" - answered from the same data the dashboard uses, so the numbers never disagree.

## Tools & Capabilities

Forty tools grouped into three areas:

| Area | Tools |
|---|---|
| Your apps | `get_keyword_rankings`, `get_keyword_opportunities`, `get_revenue_and_churn`, listing analytics |
| Competitors & market | `get_competitors`, `get_keyword_apps`, `find_niches`, the whole catalog |
| Reviews & signals | `get_review_intelligence`, `get_forum_mentions`, `get_listing_changes` |

The full tool reference is published at bestappify.com/docs/api alongside 27 REST endpoints serving the same data over plain HTTP.

## Installation

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http bestappify https://bestappify.app/api/mcp --header "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

Create a free account, mint a key from the dashboard, and connect. Cursor and Windsurf configs are published on the vendor page.

## Configuration

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "bestappify": {
      "url": "https://bestappify.app/api/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Business Relevance

- **Shopify app founders** track their own keyword rankings and revenue against the live store
- **App marketers** find keywords where a weaker app outranks them and prioritize fixes
- **Product teams** summarize review complaints by theme to steer the roadmap
- **Market researchers** size niches with `find_niches` and watch competitors' listing changes

## Integration with CorpusIQ

BestAppify is the store layer; CorpusIQ is the business layer. A composed session can hold the app's Stripe revenue and GA4 signup attribution in CorpusIQ while BestAppify answers store questions - rankings, review themes, competitor moves - so "why did installs dip this week" gets both the store-side signal (a competitor took our keyword) and the business-side proof (GA4 shows the traffic drop) in one answer.

## Limitations

- Shopify App Store only - not Google Play, Apple or other marketplaces
- Free tier capped at 100 requests/day; heavier use needs a paid plan
- Hosted vendor service; requires a BestAppify account and API key
- New MCP listing (Aug 2026); 40 tools is a large surface to navigate
- Data reflects the vendor's store tracking, not Shopify's own API directly
