# Plaud MCP Server ★ New (July 4)

## Overview

Plaud MCP connects AI agents to your Plaud.ai recording library. Plaud is an AI-powered voice recorder that captures meetings, calls, and conversations - then transcribes and summarizes them. With the MCP server, agents can search your recording history, pull full transcripts, generate summaries, and extract action items from any conversation you've captured.

**Key advantage**: Your AI assistant gains access to every conversation you've recorded. Ask "what was the client's feedback on the Q3 roadmap?" and get answers grounded in actual meeting transcripts, not memory.

## Key Features

- **Recording search**: Full-text search across all recordings, transcripts, and summaries
- **Transcript retrieval**: Pull complete transcripts with speaker labels and timestamps
- **Document generation**: Create meeting notes, summaries, and action-item lists from recordings
- **Cross-recording analysis**: Find patterns, recurring topics, and commitments across multiple recordings
- **AI-powered summaries**: Generate concise summaries of any recording via the Plaud AI engine
- **Remote endpoint**: Hosted MCP server - connect directly, no local installation needed

## Installation

```bash
# Add to Hermes (remote SSE endpoint)
hermes mcp add plaud --url https://api.plaud.ai/mcp
```

## Configuration

1. Obtain your Plaud API credentials from [docs.plaud.ai](https://docs.plaud.ai/plaud-mcp-cli/mcp)
2. Add the remote endpoint to your MCP client configuration
3. Authenticate via OAuth - your client will open a browser for one-time authorization

## Tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `search_recordings` | Search your Plaud recording library by keyword, date, or tag |
| `get_transcript` | Retrieve full transcript for a specific recording |
| `get_summary` | Get AI-generated summary of a recording |
| `list_recordings` | List recent recordings with metadata (date, duration, speakers) |
| `generate_document` | Create meeting notes, action items, or summary docs from a recording |

## Use Cases for Operators

- **Client call intelligence**: Before a follow-up call, ask your agent "what did we promise Acme Corp in our last three calls?" - it searches your Plaud recordings and surfaces commitments
- **Meeting prep**: "Summarize all conversations about the pricing change from the last two weeks"
- **Knowledge preservation**: Every customer call, team standup, and partner meeting becomes a searchable knowledge asset
- **Cross-functional alignment**: "Find every mention of the API migration across all recordings this month"

## Why Operators Need This

Operators spend 40%+ of their time in meetings. Most of those insights evaporate within 48 hours. Plaud MCP turns every recorded conversation into a persistent, queryable memory that your AI assistant can draw on - so you stop forgetting decisions and start building on them.
