# QuestDB MCP Server

**Official MCP server from QuestDB** (`@questdb/mcp-server-questdb`, formerly `@questdb/mcp-bridge`). Connects coding agents (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, OpenCode, Gemini CLI) to a running QuestDB Web Console: the agent gets tools to create notebook cells, run queries, and build charts. Every action executes in the browser against your already-established QuestDB session.

```
Server type: Local (stdio, npm)
Auth: Via your QuestDB Web Console session
Repo: https://github.com/questdb/mcp-server-questdb
Install: npx @questdb/mcp-server-questdb setup
Category: Database / Time-Series Analytics
```

## Why This Matters for Operators

QuestDB is one of the fastest time-series databases in the open-source ecosystem - used for market data, IoT telemetry, and event analytics. Its MCP bridge puts an agent inside the console you already run: ad-hoc queries become notebook cells, results become charts, all against your live session and permissions. No API keys to mint, no export pipeline to build - the agent works exactly where an analyst would.

## Tools & Capabilities

- **Notebook cells** - create and run cells in the QuestDB console
- **Queries** - execute SQL against your live database
- **Charts** - build visualizations from query results
- **Session-scoped** - executes in the browser against your established, authenticated QuestDB session
- **Version-pinned** - the wizard pins each agent config to the bridge version your console expects

## Installation

```bash
# Interactive wizard (recommended) - detects Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, OpenCode, Gemini CLI
npx @questdb/mcp-server-questdb setup
```

Or add manually to your MCP client config:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "questdb": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@questdb/mcp-server-questdb"]
    }
  }
}
```

If you're on an older console, run the matching version: `npx @questdb/mcp-server-questdb@<version> setup`. On an old `@questdb/mcp-bridge` install, run `npx @questdb/mcp-bridge upgrade` once to migrate configs.

## Configuration

Environment variables: `CONSOLE_ORIGIN` (your QuestDB Web Console URL) and `MCP_BRIDGE_PORT` can be overridden during setup or set directly. The wizard writes the pinned bridge version into each detected agent's config.

## Business Relevance

- **Data teams** get ad-hoc querying through an agent without exposing read/write database credentials - the agent inherits the console session
- **Analysts** can ask for a chart and get one, in the console the whole team already uses
- **Operators running QuestDB for market data or telemetry** get notebook-style exploration from any coding agent
- **Official + Apache-2.0** - vendor-maintained, audit-friendly

## Integration with CorpusIQ

QuestDB MCP covers the high-frequency, time-series end of the data spectrum where CorpusIQ's business-connector layer stops: CorpusIQ pulls structured business records (orders, invoices, ad spend), while QuestDB holds the event streams (sensor data, clickstreams, tick data). An agent can join the two views - operational records from CorpusIQ, time-series trends from QuestDB - to answer questions like "did the traffic spike convert into orders?" across both systems in one workflow.

## Limitations

- New package (0.3.0+ era); formerly published as `@questdb/mcp-bridge` - name migration may confuse old configs
- Requires a running QuestDB Web Console with an established session - not a standalone server
- Local stdio only - no hosted/remote endpoint
- Browser-session architecture means headless/CI usage depends on your console setup
- Tool surface is console-scoped: cells, queries, charts - not a general DB admin API
