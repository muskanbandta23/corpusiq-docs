# IBANforge MCP Server

IBANforge brings banking validation and compliance tools to AI agents through MCP. Validate IBANs, look up BIC/SWIFT codes, check Swiss clearing numbers, and classify EMI/vIBAN accounts - all from any MCP-compatible client.

## What It Does

IBANforge exposes 6 tools for banking operations:

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `validate-iban` | Validate IBAN format and checksum for 80+ countries |
| `lookup-swift` | Resolve BIC/SWIFT codes to bank details |
| `lookup-iban` | Reverse-lookup bank info from IBAN |
| `swiss-clearing` | Validate Swiss clearing numbers (BC-Nummer) |
| `classify-emi` | Classify EMI (Electronic Money Institution) accounts |
| `classify-viban` | Classify virtual IBAN accounts |

## Why Operators Need This

International payments fail constantly from bad bank details. IBANforge lets your AI agent catch validation errors before they become payment rejections. For e-commerce operators processing SEPA payments, fintech operators doing KYC/compliance, or accounting teams reconciling international transactions, this eliminates a manual validation step that costs 2-5 minutes per transaction.
