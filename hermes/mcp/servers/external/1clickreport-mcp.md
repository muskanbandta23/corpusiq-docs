## Use Cases for Business Operators

### 1. Weekly Marketing Audit
Replace the manual Friday-afternoon spreadsheet session:

```
Agent prompt: "Run a full audit of all our ad accounts this week.
Show me: total spend, revenue (from Stripe), true ROAS by channel,
top 5 performing campaigns, top 5 worst performers, and total
wasted spend (keywords/audiences with >$100 spend and 0 conversions).
Recommend 3 changes that would improve ROAS this weekend."
```

### 2. Funnel Leak Detection
Find where prospects drop off:

```
Agent prompt: "Analyze our Meta Ads → landing page → checkout funnel.
Where's the biggest drop-off? Is it the ad creative, the landing page,
or the checkout flow? Show conversion rate at each step and compare
to last month."
```

### 3. Cross-Platform Budget Optimization
Don't guess - let the data decide:

```
Agent prompt: "We have $500/day to spend. Look at last 30 days'
performance across Google Ads and Meta Ads. What's the optimal
split to maximize revenue? If we're hitting diminishing returns
on one platform, show the reallocation math."
```

### 4. Launch Performance Retrospective
Analyze what actually worked:

```
Agent prompt: "Our product launch was 2 weeks ago. Pull all ad data,
landing page analytics, and Stripe revenue for the launch period.
What was our blended CAC? Which creative drove the most revenue?
Which audience had the highest LTV signals? What should we double
down on for the next launch?"
```

## Integration with CorpusIQ

1ClickReport MCP + CorpusIQ = complete marketing command center:

1. **CorpusIQ CRM connector** → enrich customer profiles with ad source data
2. **CorpusIQ email connector** → trigger re-engagement flows based on funnel drop-off
3. **CorpusIQ database connector** → store campaign performance history for trend analysis
4. **AI agent** → run weekly audits, detect anomalies, and push recommendations to Slack

This replaces the "log into 5 platforms, export CSVs, build a spreadsheet, present findings" workflow with a single agent command that produces a board-ready report in seconds.

## Pricing

- **1ClickReport MCP:** Remote MCP server (no local install)

## Limitations
