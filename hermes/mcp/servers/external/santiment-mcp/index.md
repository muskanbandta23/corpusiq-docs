- **Insights** - Full analyst insights published on Santiment, with tags, authors, and predictions.
- **Trending Stories** - What narratives are driving crypto markets right now, with bullish/bearish sentiment breakdowns.

## Use Cases for CorpusIQ

### Market Research for Content
Ask your agent: "What are the top 5 trending narratives in crypto this week?" Santiment returns stories ranked by social traction with sentiment breakdowns. Use this to inform content strategy for fintech-adjacent audiences.

### Competitor Intelligence
For crypto-native competitors: "Screen assets in the AI-agent category by developer activity growth over 30 days." Identify which projects are gaining real traction vs. social hype.

### Due Diligence
When evaluating crypto-integrated partners: "Show me on-chain activity trends for [token] over the last 90 days, plus any divergence between social sentiment and active addresses." Catch tokens where hype outpaces actual usage.

## Example Queries

**Market research:** "What's trending in crypto right now? Give me the top 3 stories with sentiment."
**Validation:** "Is this token's hype backed by real usage? Show me social volume vs. active addresses for the last month."
**Screening:** "Find the top 10 assets by developer activity growth in the last 30 days."
**Divergence detection:** "Show me any assets where social sentiment is high but on-chain activity is declining."

## Pricing

- **Free tier:** Core metrics and signals available with free Santiment account
- **Pro/API tiers:** Higher rate limits, additional metrics, and historical depth available through [SanAPI](https://academy.santiment.net/sanapi/) subscriptions

## Limitations

- **Crypto-only:** No equities, commodities, or traditional finance data
- **Rate limits:** Free tier has call limits; production use requires Pro subscription
- **OAuth dependency:** Requires browser flow for initial authorization (not headless-friendly)
- **Metric coverage:** 500+ assets covered; niche tokens may have limited data

## Verdict

Santiment MCP is the most comprehensive crypto market intelligence MCP we've cataloged. For operators in fintech, crypto payments, or Web3 - this is essential infrastructure. The OAuth setup is clean, the free tier is genuinely useful, and the combined-trends tool provides signal that previously required manual dashboard-hopping.

**Rating: ★★ - Essential for crypto/fintech operators**
