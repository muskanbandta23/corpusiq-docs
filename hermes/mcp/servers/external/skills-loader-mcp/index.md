# Skills Loader

**Source:** mcp.so submission #3293 (July 24, 2026) · Website: [skls.to](https://skls.to) · MCP Endpoint: `https://skills.agentsandswarms.ai/mcp`

## What It Does

The knowledge layer your AI is missing. Skills Loader indexes 1,900+ security-reviewed agent skills for discovery via MCP. AI agents can browse, search, and recommend skills across categories - development, design, marketing, data analysis, DevOps, and more. Free and open, no auth required for browsing.

**Key capabilities:**
- Discover 1,900+ security-reviewed skills from any MCP client
- Auto-detects your IDE and installs skills (`npx @agentsandswarms/skills-loader install`)
- Category browsing, search, and AI-powered skill recommendations
- Zero auth required for discovery

## Relevance to Operators

Directly useful for operators discovering AI agent tooling:
- Find pre-built skills for common operational workflows (SEO audits, data analysis, competitive research)
- Skip the GitHub search - curated, security-reviewed skills in one MCP
- Install skills directly from MCP without manual repo cloning
- Free and open - no vendor lock-in

**Rating:** ★★ - New (July 2026), zero GitHub stars. But 1,900+ reviewed skills makes it immediately useful. The "security-reviewed" claim is a differentiator vs raw GitHub search. Free and open with no auth gate is refreshing.

## Quick Integration

**Transport:** Streamable HTTP (remote); stdio via npm  
**Auth:** None required for browsing/recommendation  
**Pricing:** Free and open source  

```bash
# Install via npm (auto-detects IDE)
npx @agentsandswarms/skills-loader install

# Or add to MCP config directly
```

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "skills-loader": {
      "url": "https://skills.agentsandswarms.ai/mcp",
      "transport": "streamable-http"
    }
  }
}
```

## Use Cases

1. **Agent Skill Discovery:** "Find me skills for SEO content analysis" → browse reviewed options
2. **CI/CD Pipeline:** Install security-reviewed skills in build agents without manual vetting
3. **Operator Toolbelt:** Discover skills for Google Analytics, Stripe reporting, social media scheduling
4. **Education:** Browse skill categories to learn what agents can automate

## Caveats

- Zero GitHub stars - brand new project, verify security claims independently
- 1,900 skills may include many low-quality or abandoned entries
- No install stats or community ratings visible yet
- Core dependency on agentsandswarms.ai infrastructure
