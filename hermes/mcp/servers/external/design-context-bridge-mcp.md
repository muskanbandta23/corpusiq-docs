# Design Context Bridge MCP Server ★ New (July 4)

## Overview

Design Context Bridge (`design-context-bridge`) turns AI coding agents into frontend developers that can actually read Figma files - not guess from screenshots. When you hand a developer a Figma file and say "build this," they don't just copy visible pixels. They open the file, identify components, read exact colors and type scales, infer routes, figure out hover and disabled states, and export icons. This MCP server gives AI agents that same access, faithfully - not approximately.

**Key advantage**: Bridges the biggest gap in AI-assisted frontend development - agents go from "approximating what a design looks like" to "reading the actual design system."

## Key Features

- **Figma file reading**: Direct Figma API access - read layers, components, styles
- **Component identification**: Automatically detect components, variants, and instances
- **Design tokens extraction**: Extract colors, type scale, spacing, and shadows as structured tokens
- **Route inference**: Identify screens and infer navigation/routing structure from the design
- **Icon export**: Extract and export icons in SVG format with correct names
- **State detection**: Identify hover, active, disabled, and focus states from component variants
- **Responsive breakpoints**: Detect layout variations across screen sizes

## Installation

```bash
# Install from GitHub
git clone https://github.com/CristinaFores/design-context-bridge
cd design-context-bridge
npm install

# Add to Hermes
hermes mcp add design-context-bridge --command "node" --args "path/to/design-context-bridge/index.js"
```

## Configuration

1. Obtain a Figma personal access token from [Figma account settings](https://www.figma.com/developers/api#access-tokens)
2. Set the `FIGMA_ACCESS_TOKEN` environment variable
3. Configure the MCP server with your Figma file URLs

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "design-context-bridge": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["path/to/design-context-bridge/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "FIGMA_ACCESS_TOKEN": "your-figma-token"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `read_figma_file` | Read a Figma file's full structure - layers, components, styles |
| `get_components` | Extract all components with variants, states, and properties |
| `get_design_tokens` | Export colors, typography, spacing, and shadows as structured tokens |
| `infer_routes` | Identify screens and generate navigation structure |
| `export_icons` | Extract icons as SVG with proper naming |
| `get_component_states` | Identify all states (hover, active, disabled, focus) for a component |
| `get_responsive_breakpoints` | Detect layout variations across different frame sizes |

## Use Cases for Operators

- **Rapid prototyping**: Give your agent a Figma URL and ask it to build a working frontend - it reads the actual design, not a screenshot
- **Design system extraction**: Extract your entire design system (colors, type, spacing, components) as code-ready tokens in one command
- **Design QA**: "Check if the deployed frontend matches the Figma - which components have wrong colors or spacing?"
- **Icon pipeline**: Export all icons from Figma to your codebase with correct names, sizes, and formats automatically

## Why Operators Need This

The design-to-code handoff is where most product velocity leaks. Designers build pixel-perfect Figma files, developers approximate from screenshots, and the result is a mismatch that takes cycles to fix. Design Context Bridge eliminates the approximation - your AI agent reads the Figma file as faithfully as a human developer would, cutting implementation time and design drift.
