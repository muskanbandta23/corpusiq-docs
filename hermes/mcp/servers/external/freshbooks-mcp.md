# FreshBooks MCP - Accounting Automation for Hermes Agent

FreshBooks MCP connects your AI agent directly to FreshBooks accounting - manage clients, create and send invoices, track expenses, and record payments without touching the FreshBooks dashboard.

## What It Does

FreshBooks MCP brings small-business accounting into the agent workflow:

- **Client management** - List, search, create, and update clients
- **Invoice operations** - Create, send, and track invoices with line items
- **Expense tracking** - Log expenses with categories, attachments, and tax info
- **Payment recording** - Record payments against invoices, track outstanding balances
- **Reports access** - Pull profit & loss, expense reports, and invoice aging

## Quick Setup

### Prerequisites
- **FreshBooks account:** Sign up at [freshbooks.com](https://www.freshbooks.com)
- **FreshBooks API credentials:** Generate from FreshBooks Developer dashboard
- **Node.js 18+** on your machine

### Add to Hermes Agent

```bash
# Clone and configure

## Use Cases for Business Operators

### 1. Automated Client Invoicing
Have your agent generate and send invoices based on completed work:

```
Agent prompt: "We just finished the website redesign for Acme Corp.
Create a FreshBooks invoice for $4,500 - 50% deposit already paid.
Line items: Design ($2,000), Development ($2,000), Project Management ($500).
Send to billing@acmecorp.com with net-30 terms."
```

### 2. Expense Reconciliation
Feed receipts to your agent for automatic logging:

```
Agent prompt: "I have 15 receipts from my business trip. Extract the amounts,
categorize them (travel, meals, software, office), and log each
as a FreshBooks expense against the correct client project."
```

### 3. Cash Flow Monitoring
Get real-time financial visibility:

```
Agent prompt: "What's my cash position? Show me all outstanding invoices
over 30 days, total unbilled work, and upcoming expenses for the next 2 weeks.
Flag any clients who are 60+ days past due."
```

### 4. Tax Preparation
Pull categorized financials for tax season:

```
Agent prompt: "Pull my full-year 2026 P&L broken down by category.
Export all expenses with receipts for my CPA. Flag any large
uncategorized transactions."
```

## Integration with CorpusIQ

FreshBooks MCP + CorpusIQ = complete financial operations:

1. **CorpusIQ Stripe connector** → auto-record payments against FreshBooks invoices
2. **CorpusIQ email connector** → find vendor invoices for expense creation
3. **AI agent** → reconcile Stripe payouts, bank feeds, and FreshBooks in one pass
4. **CorpusIQ Gmail connector** → auto-attach emailed receipts to expenses

This replaces the manual "export CSV from Stripe, import to FreshBooks, match by hand" workflow with an agent that does it in seconds.
