# mcp-sanctions - Watchlist Screening for KYC and AML

**Stdio MCP server (PyPI)** - screens persons and organizations against public watchlists (Rosfinmonitoring, OFAC SDN, EU consolidated, UK OFSI, UN Security Council) with neutral match output: match level, list version and check date in every answer, plus a disclaimer. Manual verification remains required.

## Why This Matters for Operators

Screening a counterparty against five watchlists in one call, with an explicit neutral match level instead of a binary verdict, is exactly the output a compliance workflow needs: the tool reports the match against a dated list version and leaves the decision to a human. It is built to be an input to KYC/AML processes, not a replacement for them.

## Tools & Capabilities (4 tools)

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| screen_person | Screen a natural person by full name, optionally with date of birth |
| screen_entity | Screen an organization by name, INN or OGRN |
| screen_inn | Quick lookup by Russian tax identification number |
| list_watchlists | Metadata on supported lists and their update dates |

## Installation

```bash
pipx install atomno-mcp-sanctions
# or: uvx atomno-mcp-sanctions
```

Cursor or Claude Desktop (mcp.json):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "sanctions": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["atomno-mcp-sanctions"],
      "env": { "MCP_SANCTIONS_API_KEY": "<your-pro-key>" }
    }
  }
}
```

## Configuration

- MCP_SANCTIONS_API_KEY - Pro key from atomno-mcp.ru/pricing, sent as the X-API-Key header (required)
- MCP_SANCTIONS_API_BASE - hosted backend URL (default https://api.atomno-mcp.ru/sanctions)
- MCP_SANCTIONS_TIMEOUT - HTTP timeout in seconds (default 30)

## Business Relevance

Useful for: compliance officers screening counterparties across five jurisdictions at once, KYC onboarding checks with auditable list versions and dates, and due-diligence workflows where the answer must state its source rather than assert a verdict.

## Limitations

The Central Bank of Russia denylist is not supported (not public). The tool explicitly does not make judgements and is not a basis for decisions on its own; every answer carries a disclaimer that data may age. Pro key required for the hosted data backend.
