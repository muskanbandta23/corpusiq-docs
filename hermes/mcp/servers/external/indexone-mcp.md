# Index One MCP

**Category:** Finance / Fintech / Investment  
**Transport:** TBD (likely Remote HTTP)  
**Auth:** TBD  
**Repository:** Not confirmed (multiple financial repos referenced)  
**mcpservers.org:** https://mcpservers.org/servers/indexone-io-docs-mcp  

## What It Does for Operators

Index One MCP provides AI agents with access to financial index data, backtesting capabilities, and systematic investment strategy deployment. Business operators in finance, wealth management, and investment firms can use this to automate portfolio analysis, run strategy simulations, and deploy algorithmic trading logic through MCP-native tools.

## Installation

```bash
# Installation TBD - server is newly listed
```

## Claude Desktop / Hermes Config

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "indexone": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "indexone-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "API_KEY": "your-api-key"
      }
    }

}
```

## Key Tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Query financial indices | Access index data across markets |
| Run backtests | Simulate strategies against historical data |
| Deploy strategies | Build and deploy systematic investment strategies |

## Operator Use Cases

1. **Portfolio analysis** - Query index performance data for investment decisions
2. **Strategy backtesting** - Run historical simulations before deploying capital
3. **Automated reporting** - Generate investment performance reports via AI agents
4. **Risk assessment** - Use index data for risk modeling and exposure analysis
5. **Market monitoring** - Track index movements and trigger alerts

## CorpusIQ Angle

Index One fits into CorpusIQ's financial data ecosystem. Operators using CorpusIQ for business intelligence could integrate index data alongside their QuickBooks, Stripe, and other financial connectors for comprehensive financial analysis.

## Limitations

- New listing with limited documentation
- Specific GitHub repository not confirmed (multiple repos referenced on mcpservers.org page)
- Financial data may require paid API access
- Not yet battle-tested in production MCP workflows
