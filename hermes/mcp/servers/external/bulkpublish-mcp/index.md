# BulkPublish MCP - Multi-Platform Social Publishing for Agents

**Stdio MCP server (npx) plus a hosted HTTP transport** - lets AI assistants run the BulkPublish social publishing API: create and schedule posts across 11 platforms, manage media uploads, RSS autoposting, channel sets and labels, and read engagement analytics, all through natural conversation.

## Why This Matters for Operators

Social publishing for agents has matured into full operations: BulkPublish covers the whole post lifecycle with team approval (approve_post, reject_post), failure recovery (retry_post, bulk_posts), recurring schedules, RSS autoposting with draft or publish modes, and channel token health checks. The hosted transport is multi-tenant and lets discovery run keyless while tool calls require the caller's own key.

## Tools & Capabilities (~50 README-documented tools)

| Group | Tools |
|---|---|
| Posts | create_post, compose_post, update_post, get_post, list_posts, delete_post, publish_post, retry_post, approve_post, reject_post, get_post_metrics, publish_story, bulk_posts, get_queue_slot |
| Channels | list_channels, get_channel_health, get_channel_options, search_mentions |
| Channel sets | list_channel_sets, create_channel_set, update_channel_set, delete_channel_set |
| RSS autopost | list_rss_feeds, create_rss_feed, update_rss_feed, delete_rss_feed |
| Media | upload_media, get_media, list_media, delete_media, create_media_upload, finalize_media_upload, create_multipart_upload, complete_multipart_upload, abort_multipart_upload |
| Labels | create_label, list_labels, update_label, delete_label |
| Analytics & account | get_analytics, get_quota_usage |
| Schedules | list_schedules, create_schedule, update_schedule, delete_schedule |
| MCP Apps UI | view_analytics, view_posts, view_channels, view_media, view_quota |

## Installation

```bash
npx @bulkpublish/mcp-server
```

Claude Desktop config adds the package with the BULKPUBLISH_API_KEY environment variable. Claude Code: `claude mcp add bulkpublish -- npx -y @bulkpublish/mcp-server`.

For claude.ai custom connectors or Smithery's gateway, deploy the bundled Streamable HTTP transport and connect to `https://<host>/mcp?key=bp_...`. A Dockerfile is included.

## Configuration

- Get a bp_ API key at app.bulkpublish.com/developer
- initialize, tools/list and resources need no key; a tools/call without one returns 401
- The compose_post and view_* tools render interactive MCP Apps widgets in hosts that support them, falling back to plain text elsewhere

## Business Relevance

Useful for: marketing operators running multi-platform content calendars through an agent, agencies handling many client accounts with channel sets and approval flows, and content teams automating RSS-to-social pipelines with draft review gates.

## Integration with CorpusIQ

Complementary to CorpusIQ's business-data connectors: BulkPublish handles the publishing execution layer while CorpusIQ supplies the analytics and operational data that decides what to publish.

## Limitations

API key required for all writes. Analytics read depends on platform-provided metrics; unsupported metric keys are stored as 0, not measured. Requires Node 20.19+ for the stdio server.
