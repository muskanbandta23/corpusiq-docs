## Why This Matters for Operators

Operators making business decisions need external intelligence - Is a vendor vulnerable to a known CVE? Has a competitor filed new patents? Are there federal contracts in our space? Who are the key nonprofits in our market? DataNexus answers all of these from a single MCP server with verified, structured data. No more cobbling together 5 different APIs.

## Installation

```bash
# Via npm
npm install -g datanexus-mcp

# Or run directly
npx datanexus-mcp
```

|----------|-------|----------|
| CVE / Vulnerabilities | 10+ | Vendor security audits, supply chain risk |

## Authentication

Requires a DataNexus API key. Sign up at [datanexusmcp.com](https://datanexusmcp.com). Free tier available.

## CorpusIQ Angle

DataNexus's public data tools complement CorpusIQ's private business data connectors (QuickBooks, Shopify, Stripe). Together they form a complete business intelligence layer: private financials via CorpusIQ + public market intelligence via DataNexus. Patent and federal contract data could specifically fuel lead intelligence for B2B operators.
