# Oromi Agent Services MCP

**AI agents for UK business operations** - 25 pay-per-call tools accessible through any MCP client. Companies House registry, HM Land Registry property data, agent-readiness audits, domain/email verification, and even human-in-the-loop tasks.

## What It Is

Oromi Agent Services provides machine-payable APIs (via x402/USDC on Base) that expose verified UK business and property data to AI agents. All 25 tools auto-generate from a live OpenAPI spec, so your agent always has current schemas. Two MCP access methods: `npx` package (auto-pays via x402) or remote `/mcp` endpoint.

## Why Business Operators Should Care

If you or your agents operate in the UK market, Oromi replaces four separate data sources with one MCP connection:

- **UK Company Due Diligence**: Companies House profiles, officers, SIC codes, accounts due dates, domain trust signals - one call with a red-flag verdict (`/api/uk-business/due-diligence`, $0.10)
- **Property Market Intelligence**: Sold prices, price trends, area crime stats, mortgage math, EPC ratings - all from HM Land Registry and official sources
- **Business Name Checking**: Verify proposed company names against the live Companies House register before filing
- **Agent Readiness Scanning**: Audit any website for agent-usable structured data (schema.org, contact channels, booking links) with a 0-100 score
- **Citation Insurance**: Verify URLs, emails, domains, EU VAT numbers, and IBANs before your agent acts on them
- **Human-in-the-Loop**: Real humans answer yes/no questions ($0.50) or perform small tasks ($3.00) - answered within 2 hours during UK business hours

## Setup

### Remote MCP (Recommended)

Add to any MCP client as a remote server:

```
Endpoint: https://agents.oromi.co.uk/mcp
Transport: Streamable HTTP
Auth: x402 (USDC on Base)
```

### Local Package

```bash
npx -y oromi-agent-services-mcp
```

The npx package auto-handles x402 micropayments. All 25 tools are discovered automatically from the live OpenAPI spec - no manual tool registration needed.

## Business Use Cases

### Due Diligence on UK Prospects
Your agent pulls a full due-diligence pack ($0.10): company status, officers, domain age, HTTPS status, and a red-flag verdict - all before you spend time on outbound.

### Property Investment Research
Agent checks an area's market summary ($0.03) + sold prices ($0.02) + crime stats ($0.02) + mortgage math ($0.005) - $0.075 total for a complete investment snapshot from official data.

### Business Name Validation
Before registering a UK company, your agent checks name availability ($0.01) against the live Companies House register - catches exact matches and similar names that would be rejected.

### Agent-Ready Website Audits
Scan any business website ($0.05) to see if AI agents can interact with it programmatically - schema.org data, booking links, opening hours, contact channels, and a 0-100 readiness score with per-check breakdown.

### Human Sanity Checks
For high-stakes decisions where you want a second pair of eyes: `human-verify` ($0.50) gets a real person to answer yes/no questions like "Does this website look legitimate?" or "Is this photo actually the product described?"

## Limitations

- **UK-only**: All business/property data is UK-specific. Companies House, HM Land Registry, FSA, and UK statutory rates.
- **x402 micropayments required**: Pay-per-call via USDC on Base. Budget accordingly for high-volume agent workflows.
- **Human tasks async**: `human-verify` and `human-task` are async (typically <2 hours, UK business hours 08:00-22:00).
- **Scotland/NI property**: EPC data is England & Wales only (separate registers for Scotland/NI return zero with explanatory note).
- **No bulk endpoints**: Each call is priced individually. For bulk due diligence, batch multiple calls.

## Pricing Summary

- **Micro-checks**: $0.001-$0.01 (URL status, IBAN, rates, email verify, fx)
- **Business data**: $0.005-$0.10 (search, company profile, due diligence)
- **Property data**: $0.005-$0.03 (mortgage math, sold prices, market summary, crime)
- **Agent tools**: $0.01-$0.05 (web extract, PDF extract, agent-ready scan, JSON validate)
- **Human tasks**: $0.50-$3.00 (async verification, small tasks)

## CorpusIQ Integration Potential

Oromi's agent-readiness scan ($0.05) could complement CorpusIQ's business connector approach - identify whether a prospect's website is structured for agent interaction before CorpusIQ attempts integrations. The due-diligence endpoint ($0.10) could feed lead qualification pipelines.
