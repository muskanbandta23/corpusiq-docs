# MCP Server Scan - July 13, 2026

**Source:** mcp.so (curl extraction - SPA inline JSON parsing)
**Date:** July 13, 2026
**Previous scan:** July 12, 2026
**GitHub API:** Unavailable (rate-limited as of July 12)
**mcpservers.org:** Unavailable (SolidJS SPA, no server data in initial HTML)

## Methodology

mcp.so frontend loads all server data as inline JSON in the initial HTML payload (`$R` references in the TanStack Router hydration script). Server entries were extracted by parsing the `createdAt` fields and filtering for today's date (July 13, 2026).

## New Servers Found: 7 total, 4 business-relevant

3. **Mobile app ecosystem MCP:** AppAmbit brings the full mobile dev lifecycle (analytics, crash reporting, build distribution, CMS) into MCP - first comprehensive mobile-dev MCP server.
4. **AI industry intelligence:** Horizon provides free AI regulation tracking and regional briefings - fills a gap for operators who need to track AI policy changes.
