## CorpusIQ Angle

BasedOnBusiness is a lead generation powerhouse for operators. Paired with CorpusIQ's business data connectors, operators can: (1) discover leads via BasedOnBusiness, (2) qualify them with enrichment data, (3) manage the pipeline in HubSpot (CorpusIQ CRM connector), and (4) track financial performance in QuickBooks - all through AI agent commands.

## Limitations

- Requires paid API key for full enrichment data
- Data accuracy depends on Google Maps listings + enrichment sources
- Rate limits on batch searches
- Email enrichment may not be available for all businesses
