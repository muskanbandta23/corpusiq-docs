# SEOforGPT - AI Visibility / GEO MCP Server

## What It Is

SEOforGPT is the first purpose-built Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) platform. As search shifts from Google to AI platforms (ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, Gemini), SEOforGPT gives agencies a systematic way to audit, track, and optimize client visibility across every major AI platform - directly from their AI assistant.

**Key advantage**: Complete agency workflow in one MCP connection - audit → track → generate → publish.

## Tools Available

| Category | Tools |
|----------|-------|
| **Audit** | Run AI visibility audits for any domain across ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, Gemini |
| **Track** | Monitor competitor AI visibility, track which sources AI platforms cite |
| **Generate** | Create AI-optimized content that surfaces in LLM responses |
| **Publish** | Push content directly to client CMS platforms |

## Quick Start

```bash
# Add to Hermes
hermes mcp add seoforgpt --url https://api.seoforgpt.com/mcp

# Authenticate
hermes mcp auth seoforgpt
# → Connects to your SEOforGPT workspace
# → Done. All client workspaces available.
```

## Manual Configuration

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "seoforgpt": {
      "url": "https://api.seoforgpt.com/mcp",
      "transport": "sse"
    }
  }
}
```

## Business Use Cases

1. **Client Audits**: Run AI visibility audits for agency clients - "How visible is Client X on ChatGPT vs. Claude?"
2. **Competitor Intelligence**: Track which sources competitors are cited by and identify content gaps
3. **GEO Content Strategy**: Generate content optimized for AI platform visibility (not just Google)
4. **Retainer Expansion**: Add GEO services to existing SEO retainers - new revenue from existing clients

## Why This Matters Now

Google's search monopoly is fragmenting. ChatGPT has 200M+ weekly users. Perplexity processes 100M+ queries/month. Claude and Gemini are growing fast. The agencies that add GEO to their service menu now will own the next decade of search marketing.

## Limitations

- Requires SEOforGPT account (paid platform)
- GEO is an emerging field - best practices are still evolving
- AI platform behavior changes frequently - results require ongoing monitoring
