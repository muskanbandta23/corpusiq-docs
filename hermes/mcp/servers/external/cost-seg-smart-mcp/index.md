## Why This Matters for Operators

Cost segregation reclassifies parts of a building from the default 39- or 27.5-year depreciation life into 5- and 15-year classes, pulling depreciation forward into the years an owner is most likely to need it. The catch has always been the sales process: quoting requires an engineer's time before the buyer knows whether the study pays for itself.

**The MCP turns the feasibility question into one tool call.** A $750,000 short-term rental at a 37% bracket returns a $995 study cost against an estimated $184,500 year-one deduction - $68,265 in year-one tax savings, a 69x ROI on the fee. The quote is read-only, idempotent, and free to call.

## Tools & Capabilities

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `get_cost_seg_quote` | Returns study cost, estimated year-1 accelerated depreciation, and (given a tax bracket) year-1 tax savings and ROI on the fee |
| `get_cost_seg_payment_link` | Generates a Stripe Checkout URL for the quoted study |

Covers 21 property types - single-family, short-term rentals, condos, ADUs, duplex through fourplex, multifamily, office, retail, industrial, mixed-use, medical office, and restaurant.

## Installation

claude mcp add cost-seg-smart --transport http https://costsegsmart.com/mcp

## Business Relevance

- **CPAs** price feasibility for clients before committing to studies
- **Fractional CFOs** surface tax-savings opportunities to every real estate client
- **Real estate investors** check whether a property justifies a study before buying
- **Tax-software workflows** embed study pricing and checkout directly

## Integration with CorpusIQ

Cost Seg Smart pairs with the CorpusIQ accounting stack: QuickBooks holds the fixed-asset schedule, Stripe shows the payment rail the checkout link runs through, and Cost Seg Smart MCP supplies the study economics. A composed workflow quotes a portfolio property, logs the estimated year-one deduction, and files the paid invoice against the QuickBooks fixed-asset accounts.

## Limitations

- Estimates based on industry-standard construction cost data; actual results vary with property condition and finishes - not tax advice
- US properties only
- Study pricing is commercial (from $995)
- Brand new - no track record yet
