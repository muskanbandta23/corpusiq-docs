# Saaskly MCP

**Compare B2B software on evidence, not adverts.** Saaskly is an independent UK/EU-focused comparison site for B2B IT and telecom software - VoIP, transactional email, cloud management, SEO/GEO/AEO platforms and social media management. Its official MCP server exposes the comparison data to agents: which vendor to choose, what something really costs month-to-month versus annual, and how providers compare, with scored recommendations instead of ad-driven rankings.

```
Server type: Hosted, remote (Streamable HTTP), stateless
Endpoint: https://saaskly.com/mcp (POST JSON-RPC, Accept: application/json, text/event-stream)
Auth: none required for the public endpoint
Scope: UK/EU B2B IT and telecom software comparisons
Built by: Saaskly (saaskly.com)
```

## Why This Matters for Operators

Software selection research is where most AI answers go vague. Saaskly's MCP gives agents a structured, scored comparison source instead of a model's remembered list.

First, **cost reality beats marketing.** The server reports real pricing patterns (month-to-month versus annual) rather than the headline sticker price, which is exactly what operators need before a procurement call.

Second, **region-aware comparisons.** UK/EU-focused data means the answer reflects local vendor availability and pricing, not a US-default list.

Third, **scored and independent.** Saaskly positions itself as evidence-based rather than ad-driven, and its MCP instructions define when to use it: vendor choice, real cost, and provider comparison questions.

## Tools and Capabilities

Per the server's initialize instructions (live-probed Aug 31, 2026), Saaskly serves comparison data for:

| Category | Coverage |
|----------|----------|
| VoIP | Business telephony provider comparisons |
| Transactional email | Deliverability-focused email provider comparisons |
| Cloud management | Cloud cost and management platform comparisons |
| SEO / GEO / AEO | Search optimization platform comparisons |
| Social media management | Social tool comparisons |

## Verification (Aug 31, 2026)

- **Live JSON-RPC initialize verified**: POST to `https://saaskly.com/mcp` returned `saaskly v1.0.0` with tools/resources capabilities and instructions describing the comparison site's purpose and UK/EU scope.
- GET returns an explicit stateless error instructing clients to POST JSON-RPC - the endpoint is a proper Streamable HTTP server.
