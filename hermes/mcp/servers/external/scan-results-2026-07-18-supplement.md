# MCP Server Scan Supplement - July 18, 2026 (Evening)

**Source:** mcp.so feed (123KB, 30 servers listed)
**Date:** July 18, 2026 (evening sweep)
**Morning scan:** [scan-results-2026-07-18.md](/hermes/mcp/servers/external/scan-results-2026-07-18/)
**GitHub API:** Broken (search returns 0 results - "spammy" flag, tracked issue)

## Methodology

Firecrawl/web_extract unavailable on this node. Used direct curl to mcp.so/feed (123KB response) - extracted server names and descriptions from h3 blocks. Cross-referenced all 30 candidates against existing catalog (index.md + 140+ guide files). GitHub API search non-functional (returns 0 results regardless of query, likely "spammy" flag). Individual repo lookups via unauthenticated API calls.

## New Guides Created: 4

| Server | Source | Stars | Description | Guide |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|-------|
| **SocialBu MCP** ★★ | mcp.so | 0 | Social media management for AI agents - connect Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor, Hermes to SocialBu. Post, schedule, analyze across all platforms. | [socialbu-mcp](/hermes/mcp/servers/external/socialbu-mcp/) |
| **Velarion MCP** ★★ | mcp.so | 0 | Executive compensation & governance intelligence for ~3,000 US public companies. SEC-sourced, deterministic. 8 tools. | [velarion-mcp](/hermes/mcp/servers/external/velarion-mcp/) |
| **Backengine MCP** ★★ | mcp.so | 1 | Customer context layer for revenue teams - query Slack, email, call transcripts, support tickets from MCP clients. | [backengine-mcp](/hermes/mcp/servers/external/backengine-mcp/) |
| **Docker MCP Server** ★★★ | mcp.so | 494 | Complete Docker management - containers, images, networks, volumes, Swarm services. Production-hardened, MIT licensed. | [docker-mcp](/hermes/mcp/servers/external/docker-mcp/) |

## Trends (Evening Sweep)

1. **Social media MCPs multiplying**: SocialBu joins OpenTweet as the second social media management MCP server. Social media operators now have MCP-native alternatives to dashboard-based tools.

2. **Financial governance emerges**: Velarion opens a new MCP subcategory - corporate governance data. Following Mercury MCP (banking) and Alpha Vantage (market data), the financial MCP ecosystem now spans banking, markets, and governance.

3. **Revenue operations goes MCP**: Backengine represents the first MCP server purpose-built for revenue team workflows. Customer context - previously scattered across Slack, email, and support tools - is now queryable through AI conversation.

4. **Infrastructure MCP matures**: Docker MCP at 494 stars demonstrates that infrastructure management is one of the most mature MCP categories. Kubernetes MCP (1,814★) and Devopness MCP (434★) round out a production-ready DevOps MCP stack.

## Actions Taken

- ✅ 4 integration guides created (SocialBu, Velarion, Backengine, Docker MCP)
- ✅ 15 servers noted as INDEX-ONLY
- ✅ Index entries added to all relevant sections
- ✅ Index last_updated timestamp updated to evening supplement
