# MCP Server Scan - July 12, 2026

**Source:** mcp.so/feed (curl extraction - SPA text parsing)
**Date:** July 12, 2026
**Previous scan:** July 4, 2026 (evening)
**GitHub API:** Unavailable (search rate-limited - "User flagged as spammy")
**mcpservers.org:** Unavailable (SolidJS SPA, no server data in initial HTML)

## Methodology

mcp.so changed its frontend from Next.js RSC payloads (`__next_f.push`) to a fully client-rendered React SPA. Raw HTML extraction of the `/feed` page via text stripping was used. The feed contains the ~30 most recent submissions. No pagination was available.

## New Servers Found: 28 total, 14 business-relevant

### Skipped (not business-relevant)
- Jmpy Mcp Server (no description)
- Computer Use Omni (Windows desktop automation - dev tool)

## Trends

1. **Financial data MCPs accelerating:** Seiche (money markets) + Financial News MCP (real-time ticker/sentiment) - operators increasingly want live financial context for agents
2. **Compliance MCPs emerging:** EU Textile Sustainability Law MCP targets a specific regulation (ESPR/DPP/CSRD) - pattern of regulation-specific MCP servers
3. **Agent governance maturing:** Agent Coherence (file conflict prevention, TLA+-verified) + Human-in-the-loop approval - operators need infrastructure to manage multi-agent systems
4. **"Live search" becoming a category:** CrustAPI joins existing search MCPs with a pay-per-result model - competition in the agent-search space

## Actions Taken

1. Created 6 integration guides for highest-value servers
2. Updated `index.md` with entries for all 14 business-relevant servers
3. Cross-referenced all servers against existing catalog (47+ guides)

## GitHub API Note

GitHub search API returned "User flagged as spammy" for all queries. Token at `secrets/github.token` may need rotation. All discovery was via mcp.so/feed only.
