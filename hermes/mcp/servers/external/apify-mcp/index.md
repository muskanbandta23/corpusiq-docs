## Overview

The **official Apify MCP server** connects AI agents to Apify's ecosystem of thousands of ready-made web scrapers, crawlers, and automation tools (called "Actors"). Agents can search the Apify Store for scrapers targeting specific websites, execute them, and retrieve structured data - all through natural language.

With 2,200+ GitHub stars and official status, this is the definitive web data extraction MCP for AI agents. The hosted endpoint at `mcp.apify.com` supports OAuth, output schema inference, and the latest features.

## Key Capabilities

- **Inspect Actors** - Get parameters, pricing, README, and input schema (`fetch-actor-details`)
- **Run Actors** - Execute a scraper/automation and retrieve results (`call-actor`)
- **Fetch results** - Retrieve paginated dataset items from completed runs (`get-dataset-items`)
- **Search docs** - Look up Apify platform guides and integration docs (`search-apify-docs`)

      "env": {
        "APIFY_TOKEN": "your-apify-token"
      }

## Security Considerations

- API token scoped to specific Actors and data access
- All Actor runs logged in Apify Console
- ⚠️ Respect robots.txt and website ToS when configuring scraping Actors
