# Hologrow MCP

**The e-commerce data layer for any AI.** Hologrow (hologrow.ai, GitHub hologrow/hologrow-mcp) sits between AI agents and e-commerce platforms, handling the hard parts - platform OAuth, sync, freshness, and schema - so agents only read. It is read-only by default: the MCP server never writes back to ad accounts or storefronts. Agents get five discovery tools plus analysis skills installable with a single command, backed by a hosted endpoint at mcp.hologrow.ai/mcp.

```
Server type: Remote (Streamable HTTP)
Auth: Platform OAuth handled by Hologrow (agents read via the hosted service)
Endpoint: https://mcp.hologrow.ai/mcp
Tools: 5 discovery tools + installable analysis skills
Pricing: Not published on the listing (vendor sales page)
Category: Commerce / E-commerce data
Built by: Hologrow Inc
```

## Why This Matters for Operators

E-commerce data is fragmented: storefronts, ad accounts, and seller platforms each have their own OAuth dance, rate limits, and schemas. Hologrow collapses that into a single read surface so an AI assistant can answer seller questions - sales, inventory, ad performance - without the operator managing half a dozen API connections. **The promise is that the assistant sees the store the way the operator does, with freshness and schema handled upstream.**

## Tools & Capabilities

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| 5 discovery tools | Surface available data sources and what can be queried per connected platform |
| Analysis skills (installable) | `npx skills@latest add hologrow/hologrow-mcp --skill hologrow-data-middleware` - deeper analytical workflows on top of the discovery surface |

The live tool list is served from the endpoint - the public listing publishes the five discovery tools and the installable skills, not the full per-platform surface.

## Installation

```bash
claude mcp add hologrow --transport http https://mcp.hologrow.ai/mcp
```

Setup uses the skills installer: `npx skills@latest add hologrow/hologrow-mcp --skill hologrow-data-middleware --global --yes`.

## Configuration

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "hologrow-mcp": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://mcp.hologrow.ai/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

## Business Relevance

- **Amazon sellers** query sales, listing, and ad data through chat without logging into seller dashboards.
- **E-commerce operators** get a unified read layer across storefront and advertising accounts - one question, one answer.
- **Founders** delegate recurring reporting ("what sold yesterday") to an assistant with fresh, synced data.
- **Data teams** skip connector maintenance for e-commerce sources and point agents at Hologrow instead.
- **Agencies** read client store data read-only, with no risk of accidental writes to ad accounts.

## Integration with CorpusIQ

Hologrow and CorpusIQ are both read-first data layers for operators, but they approach different depths. CorpusIQ connects AI agents to first-party business systems - QuickBooks, Shopify, Stripe, Google Ads, HubSpot, GA4 - with a 30-day trial and OAuth 2.1 PKCE. Hologrow focuses on the seller-side data layer (Amazon-oriented) with sync and schema handled upstream. A composed workflow: use CorpusIQ's Shopify connector for storefront operations data and financials from Stripe and QuickBooks, and Hologrow for seller-platform surfaces CorpusIQ does not cover; the assistant then has both the accounting-grade view and the marketplace view in one conversation. They pair naturally as complementary read layers rather than competitors.

## Limitations

- Brand new listing - no track record yet; tool surface not fully published (live list served from endpoint).
- Vendor pricing not disclosed on the listing - commercial terms need a sales conversation.
- Read-only by design - analysis and reporting only, no write-back workflows.
- Hosted service: data freshness depends on Hologrow's sync cadence for each platform.
