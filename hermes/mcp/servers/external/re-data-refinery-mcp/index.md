# RE Data Refinery MCP

**Pay-per-query real estate intelligence: live Zillow listings enriched with county-level data and scored for investment.** RE Data Refinery turns messy property data into clean, scored, AI-ready intelligence for Columbus, OH and 14 surrounding metro cities - combining ZillAPI listings with GIS zoning, tax delinquency, sheriff sales, permits, and probate records, then computing flip score, wholesale score, rental yield, and market heat for every property.

```
Server type: Local (Python, stdio/SSE) + hosted worker

Pricing: $0.25-$0.50 USDC per lookup (free health/credits tools)
Category: Real Estate

```

## Why This Matters for Operators

Real estate investors stitch together MLS feeds, county records, and their own scoring spreadsheets - usually across three or four subscriptions. RE Data Refinery collapses that into one agent-callable surface with per-query micropayments: agents pay $0.25-$0.50 USDC per lookup via x402 on Base, with no subscription, no API tiers, and no minimum commitment.

The differentiator is enrichment depth: county GIS, tax delinquency, sheriff sales, permits, and probate records sit alongside standard listing fields, and proprietary flip/wholesale/rental-yield/market-heat scores come pre-computed per listing. A free local fallback mode supports development without spending USDC.

| `refinery_credits` | Upstream ZillAPI credit balance | Free |
| `refinery_properties` | Scored property lists by city with price filters | $0.35 (free cached) |
| `refinery_property_detail` | Full scored detail for one property (ZPID) | $0.35 |
| `refinery_property_price_history` | Price/transaction timeline | $0.25 |

## Installation

```bash
pip install "x402>=2.20.0" eth-account httpx
git clone https://github.com/areshms/re-refinery-mcp.git
cd re-refinery-mcp
export EVM_PRIVATE_KEY=0x...
```

## Configuration

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "re_refinery_mcp": {
      "command": "python3",
      "args": ["/path/to/re-refinery-mcp/re_refinery_mcp.py"],
      "env": {
        "EVM_PRIVATE_KEY": "${EVM_PRIVATE_KEY}",
        "X402_SPEND_CAP": "$1"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The wallet must hold USDC on Base mainnet for paid lookups. Payments settle automatically via the x402 protocol using Permit2 signatures and the Coinbase CDP facilitator. `X402_SPEND_CAP` sets a per-payment cap (default $1). MIT licensed.

## Business Relevance

- **Flippers and wholesalers** source and score deals from chat instead of spreadsheets
- **Rental investors** filter by rental yield and market heat across 14 metro cities
- **Analysts** pull tax, price, and school histories per property on demand
- **Agent builders** fold property scoring into larger investment workflows with spend caps

## Integration with CorpusIQ

RE Data Refinery covers property sourcing and scoring - a domain CorpusIQ's connectors do not touch. Paired in one agent session, an investor can source and score properties through RE Data Refinery while CorpusIQ handles the financial layer: QuickBooks for the business books, Stripe for payments, and banking for deal funding - then join the two on property address or LLC name. CorpusIQ's x402-aware spend discipline (caps, per-call pricing) mirrors RE Data Refinery's pay-per-query model.

## Limitations

- Coverage is Columbus, OH metro (14 cities, 150+ seeded properties) - not national
- Requires a funded wallet and x402 client; USDC on Base only
- New listing (Aug 2026), zero-star repository, single maintainer
- Paid lookups depend on the hosted Cloudflare worker's uptime
- Local free mode uses a different (limited) data path than paid worker lookups
