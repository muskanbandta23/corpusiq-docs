# SentiSense - Market Intelligence MCP Server

## What It Is

SentiSense brings institutional-grade market intelligence into AI agents. Ask your agent about US market mood, a stock's sentiment and SentiSense Score, market-moving news, analyst ratings, and who's buying or selling (13F filings).

**Key advantage**: Zero-config OAuth. No API key to manage. Five read-only tools.

## Tools Available

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `get_market_mood` | Overall US market sentiment and mood indicators |
| `get_stock_sentiment` | SentiSense Score + sentiment analysis for any ticker |
| `get_market_news` | Market-moving news with sentiment overlay |
| `get_analyst_ratings` | Consensus analyst ratings and price targets |
| `get_institutional_activity` | 13F filing data - who's buying and selling |

## Quick Start

```bash
# Add to Hermes
hermes mcp add sentisense --url https://api.sentisense.ai/mcp

# Authenticate (OAuth - no API key needed)
