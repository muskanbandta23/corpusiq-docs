# Docker MCP Server ★ Popular (494 stars)

## Overview

The Docker MCP Server by QuantGeekDev gives AI agents full management control over Docker environments. Manage containers, images, networks, volumes, Swarm services, secrets, configs, nodes, and plugins - all through natural conversation with your AI assistant. At 494 stars and 64 forks, this is one of the most battle-tested MCP servers in the ecosystem.

**Key advantage: Operators can ask their AI to deploy, debug, and manage containers without touching a terminal - Docker management becomes conversational.**

## Key Features

- **Complete Docker surface**: Manage containers (create, start, stop, inspect, logs), images (pull, build, tag, push), networks, volumes, and Swarm services
- **Swarm orchestration**: Deploy and manage Docker Swarm services, secrets, configs, and nodes through MCP tools
- **Production-hardened**: 494 GitHub stars, 64 forks, MIT licensed - used in production environments since December 2024
- **Stdio transport**: Runs locally alongside your AI client - no cloud dependency, no data leaves your environment

## Installation

```bash
# Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/QuantGeekDev/docker-mcp.git
cd docker-mcp
npm install
npm run build
```

## Configuration

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "docker": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["path/to/docker-mcp/build/index.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Business Relevance

- **DevOps operators**: Deploy containers, check logs, restart services, and debug issues through conversation - no context-switching between AI assistant and terminal
- **Platform engineering teams**: Give every developer an AI assistant that can spin up local Docker environments, check container health, and debug networking issues - reduces "it works on my machine" incidents
- **SRE and on-call teams**: During incidents, ask your AI "show me logs for the auth service container from the last 15 minutes" - faster than SSH + grep
- **Technical founders**: Manage staging and production containers without a dedicated DevOps hire - your AI assistant becomes your infrastructure operator

## Integration with CorpusIQ

Docker MCP complements CorpusIQ's infrastructure monitoring capabilities. Combine container health data from Docker MCP with CorpusIQ's Stripe and GA4 connectors to correlate infrastructure events with business metrics - did a container restart cause a drop in signups? Your AI can answer that by cross-referencing deployment events with revenue data.

For teams running CorpusIQ's MCP endpoint on Docker, this server enables self-management - ask your AI to check the CorpusIQ MCP container health, view recent logs, and restart if needed, all through conversation.

## Limitations

- **Docker dependency**: Requires Docker Engine running locally - no remote Docker management without additional configuration
- **Stdio transport only**: Local-only deployment - cannot manage remote Docker hosts without tunneling or SSH forwarding
- **Permission model**: The AI agent gets the same Docker permissions as the user running the MCP server - no granular tool-level access control
- **Swarm-first, no K8s**: Focused on Docker Swarm - no native Kubernetes support. If you're on K8s, look at the Kubernetes MCP server instead
