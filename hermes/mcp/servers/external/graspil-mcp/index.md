## Why This Matters for Operators

Telegram has become a serious acquisition and community channel for operators - payment funnels, referral programs, broadcast marketing. But operating it means another dashboard, another login, another set of manual reports.

**Graspil MCP puts Telegram operations in plain language.** Ask "how many new users joined last week compared to the week before," "build a payment funnel report for June and save it," or "create a broadcast with this text and send it to all active users" - the agent calls the right tools and answers. The MCP server is a thin layer on the regular Graspil API, so the agent works with the same bots and permissions your API key allows.

## Tools & Capabilities

| Area | What the agent can do |
|---|---|
| Reports | List available events and resources (bots), build and preview reports |
| Stats | New-user counts, week-over-week comparisons |
| Funnels | Payment funnel reports by period |
| Referrals | Referral program earnings |
| Broadcasts | Create and send broadcasts to user segments |
| Automations | Manage automations from chat |

## Installation

```bash
claude mcp add graspil --transport http <graspil-mcp-endpoint> --header "Authorization: Bearer <api-key>"
```

## Configuration

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "graspil": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "<graspil-mcp-endpoint>",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer <api-key>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Business Relevance

- **Community operators** run Telegram groups from the assistant they already use
- **Growth leads** pull funnel and referral reports without dashboard time
- **Content teams** schedule broadcasts conversationally
- **Founders** keep Telegram economics visible in daily agent workflows

## Integration with CorpusIQ

CorpusIQ itself runs on Telegram, so Graspil's surface is directly familiar. Graspil's funnel and referral analytics complement the CorpusIQ connectors: Graspil reads Telegram economics while CorpusIQ reads the business systems behind them (Stripe for payments, GA4 for traffic, Postiz for publishing). A composed workflow monitors Telegram funnel revenue through Graspil and reconciles it against Stripe charges through CorpusIQ.

## Limitations

- Commercial; plan restrictions apply exactly as through the dashboard or API
- API-key scoping means the agent inherits the key's bot permissions
- Telegram-only surface
- Brand new - no track record yet
