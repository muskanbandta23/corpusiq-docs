# Real Wave GHL MCP

**AI labor for GoHighLevel - a hosted MCP server whose agents build the actual automation (trigger, texts, waits, branches) natively in your GoHighLevel account, ready to open in the GHL builder, plus build, test and launch agents for your business from plain-English chat.** GoHighLevel publishes no public API for building workflows, so no other AI and no Zapier-style connector can create one; Real Wave's agents author them natively. If you can describe it, your AI can build it.

```
Server type: Remote (Streamable HTTP, hosted)
Auth: OAuth sign-in (no token for major clients); token option for Manus and others
Endpoint: https://mcp.realwave.com/mcp
Requirement: paid Real Wave plan
Clients: Claude (web/desktop/mobile), ChatGPT, Cursor, VS Code, Claude Code, Codex
Category: Marketing / Agency operations
Built by: Real Wave (CloseBot partner, GoHighLevel partner)
```

## Why This Matters for Operators

GoHighLevel is the operating system for a huge swath of agencies, clinics and local service businesses - and its workflow builder is still manual labor. The highest-value automations are the boring ones: speed to lead (text every new lead within a minute), no-show recovery, reviews on autopilot, hot-lead routing, pipeline nudges, seasonal promos. Real Wave turns those into one-sentence requests that land as real, editable workflows in your GHL account. The workflows are yours even if you disconnect: they behave exactly as if built by hand.

The second half of the pitch is the agent layer: build, test and launch customer-facing agents by chat, with the GHL CRM running behind them - no drag-and-drop builders. The vendor's positioning is explicit about the efficiency claim: a few smart tools doing the work of 300+.

## Tools & Capabilities

Real Wave does not publish a static tool list (the surface is account-scoped and evolves), so the capabilities below come from the vendor's published documentation and FAQ:

| Capability | What it does |
|---|---|
| Workflow creation | Describe an automation; the agent creates trigger, texts, waits and branches natively in GHL |
| Workflow editing | Read an existing workflow, explain it in plain English, add or adjust steps on request |
| Agent building | Create, test and launch business agents from chat |
| CRM operations | Manage the GoHighLevel infrastructure running your agents |

Nothing changes without your say-so: existing workflows are read and explained first, and the vendor's FAQ states explicitly that published posts and workflow edits require approval-style action from the user. A paid Real Wave plan is required to connect; sign-in revoke is one click.

## Installation

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http realwave https://mcp.realwave.com/mcp
```

Then run `/mcp` in Claude Code and sign in via the browser. For other clients the same URL is added through each app's connector settings with OAuth (blank OAuth fields, sign in when prompted). Manus and other token-based apps use a personal connect token from Real Wave Settings > API Keys. Per-app configuration and a raw verification flow are documented on the vendor's developer page at mcp.realwave.com/mcp-server/connect.html.

## Configuration

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "realwave": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://mcp.realwave.com/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

## Business Relevance

- **GHL agencies** ship client automations from chat instead of hours in the workflow builder - and can modify existing ones the same way.
- **Clinics and local services** get speed-to-lead, no-show recovery and review-request automations built natively in their own account.
- **Operators running AI receptionists** build and test agents in plain English with the CRM attached.
- **Teams locked into GHL** finally get an API-shaped path to workflow automation without switching platforms.
