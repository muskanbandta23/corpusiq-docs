## What It Does for Operators

Search, rank, and analyze GitHub developers for tech recruiting. Location/role/skill search over millions of ranked profiles with AI scoring and contact discovery. Install via `npx githunt-mcp` or use the hosted server at `https://mcp.githunt.ai/mcp`.

## Operator Use Cases

1. **Technical recruiting** - find developers by skill, location, and activity
2. **Competitive intelligence** - analyze competitor engineering teams
3. **Vendor assessment** - evaluate open-source contributors for partnerships
4. **Talent mapping** - identify skilled developers in target regions
