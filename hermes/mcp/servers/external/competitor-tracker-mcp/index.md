# Competitor Tracker & Co. MCP - Agentic Competitive Intelligence

**Rating:** ★★★ | **Category:** Growth & Market Intelligence | **Transport:** Streamable HTTP

## What It Does

Competitor Tracker & Co. watches your competitors' websites and tells you what changed. Every week it crawls their pricing, product, messaging, and corporate pages, detects the changes that matter, and files a tagged, ranked dossier. The MCP server puts that same intelligence inside your AI assistant - subscribe to competitors, read the change feed, and pull page snapshots without leaving chat.

## Why Business Operators Need This

Competitive intelligence typically lives in a separate dashboard you check quarterly. Competitor Tracker & Co. makes it an agent-native capability: ask "what changed across my competitors this week?" and get a ranked answer with specific page snapshots showing before/after. For growth operators, product managers, and founders, this means competitive awareness becomes continuous and conversational - not a quarterly research project. ~50 tools covering reads, writes, and destructive operations with confirm-gates for safety.

**Competitive landscape:** The only MCP server purpose-built for competitive website intelligence. Closest analog is Competitor Tracker & Co.'s own web dashboard; this MCP server brings that data into agent workflows. Not a traditional SEO tool (Ahrefs, SEMrush) - focuses on website change detection, not keyword rankings.

## Example Usage

### Weekly Competitive Brief

Ask your agent: *"What changed across our competitors this week?"*

The agent calls `list_org_changes` with a date filter, returns ranked changes with page snapshots, and synthesizes a brief - pricing moves, new product pages, messaging shifts.

### Subscribe to a New Competitor

Ask your agent: *"Start tracking acme.com - pricing and product pages."*

The agent calls `subscribe_competitor` with the URL and category filters. Weekly crawls begin automatically.

### Pull a Pricing Page Snapshot

Ask your agent: *"Show me what Competitor X's pricing page looks like right now."*

The agent calls `get_snapshot` for the pricing page, returning HTML, markdown, and screenshot.

## Pricing

Competitor Tracker & Co. operates on a coin-based system. Coins cover competitor subscriptions, page tracking, and snapshot retrieval. Check [competitortracker.io](https://competitortracker.io) for current pricing.

## Verdict: ★★★ - Essential for Growth & Product Operators

Competitor Tracker & Co. is the first MCP server that makes competitive website intelligence an agent-native capability. For any operator running product or growth through AI agents, this removes the context-switch between "working in your agent" and "checking what competitors are doing." The ~50-tool surface with read/write/destructive tiers and confirm gates shows mature API design.

**Strengths:** ~50 tools covering full CI workflow, OAuth + API key auth, confirm-gated destructive operations, weekly automated crawls, page snapshots with HTML/markdown/screenshots, webhook support for programmatic alerts.

**Limitations:** Brand new (0 stars, created Jul 2026), coin-based pricing unclear at free tier, relies on website crawling (JavaScript-heavy sites may produce incomplete snapshots), no social media or ad monitoring (website-only).

**Best for:** Founders, product managers, growth operators, and competitive intelligence teams who want competitor monitoring integrated into their AI agent workflows rather than a separate dashboard.
