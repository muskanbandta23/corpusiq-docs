# Ryze Google Ads MCP

**Remote MCP server (Streamable HTTP, OAuth 2.0)** - a hosted Google Ads connector from Ryze AI that turns a Google Ads account into 14 agent tools with one sign-in. No developer token, no Cloud project, nothing to install. The same endpoint also carries Meta Ads, TikTok, GA4, Search Console and Shopify toolsets.

```
Server type: Remote (Streamable HTTP)
Auth: OAuth 2.0 (Google sign-in, one Ryze workspace per connection)
Endpoint: https://connector.get-ryze.ai/mcp
Tools: 14 (8 read, 6 write, approval-gated)
Pricing: Free to connect · Ads Autopilot $89/mo flat (optional)
Category: Marketing
Built by: Ryze AI (2,000+ clients, 700+ agencies, $500M+ managed)
```

## Why This Matters for Operators

The alternative to this server is the developer route: apply for a Google Ads API developer token, stand up a Cloud project with an OAuth consent screen, run a local Python process and babysit a client_secret.json. Ryze collapses all of that into a URL and a Google sign-in. **An operator gets GAQL reporting, Keyword Planner data and Google's own recommendations inside a chat in about sixty seconds.**

Write tools are approval-gated by default, so an agent can propose a budget change without ever being able to apply it silently. Deletes run through a separate explicit tool that only accepts an item-by-item approved list. For agencies the server is MCC-aware: it discovers every accessible customer, maps a manager to its child accounts and passes loginCustomerId through, so one connection covers the whole book of business.

## Tools & Capabilities

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `getAccountSummary` | Spend, clicks, conversions, CPA and ROAS for a date range in one call |
| `getAccountHierarchy` | Manager to sub-account tree for an MCC |
| `listAccessibleCustomers` | Every Google Ads account the signed-in login can reach |
| `listConversionActions` | Conversion actions with status, category and counting settings |
| `listRecommendations` | Google's optimization recommendations with estimated impact |
| `applyRecommendation` | Apply recommendations by resource name (write, gated) |
| `dismissRecommendation` | Dismiss recommendations so Google stops resurfacing them (write, gated) |
| `generateKeywordIdeas` | Keyword Planner ideas with monthly volume from seed keywords or a URL |
| `generateKeywordHistoricalMetrics` | Volume, competition and bid ranges for a known keyword list |
| `runRawGaql` | Any GAQL query up to 10,000 characters against reporting resources |
| `runRawMutate` | Create or update campaigns, budgets, ad groups, criteria and assets (write, gated) |
| `runRawMutateDelete` | Remove resources on an explicit item-by-item approved list (write, gated) |
| `runRawCustomAudienceMutate` | Create or update custom audiences for targeting and PMax signals (write, gated) |
| `uploadImageAsset` | Push an image asset into the Asset Library for PMax and responsive display |

## Installation

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http ryze https://connector.get-ryze.ai/mcp
```

Then run `/mcp` inside Claude Code to complete the OAuth sign-in. The vendor publishes per-client walkthroughs for Claude web and desktop, ChatGPT developer mode, Cursor, Windsurf, VS Code and Gemini CLI.

## Configuration

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ryze": {
      "url": "https://connector.get-ryze.ai/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

Auth notes: sign in with Google and pick a Ryze workspace. The hosted server brings its own Ads API access, so no developer token or client_secret.json exists anywhere in the loop. One connection maps to one workspace, so agencies with several client workspaces reconnect per workspace.

## Business Relevance

- **Paid-marketing leads** get campaign spend, CPA and ROAS pulled on demand and broken down by campaign in plain language, no Ads UI export dance.
- **Performance agencies** run MCC-aware reporting and pass loginCustomerId so one login serves every client account.
- **Media buyers** research keywords with real volume and bid-range data before the account manager opens a budget request.
- **Operator teams** keep every write approval-gated per tool, so agent-driven changes stay human-signed.

## Integration with CorpusIQ

CorpusIQ already exposes Google Ads as one of its 40+ read-only connectors, which is the right surface for financial and cross-system reporting. Ryze complements it on the action side. When a CorpusIQ dashboard flags a campaign with rising spend and falling ROAS, the operator hands the flagged dimensions to Ryze, which pulls the GAQL report, reads Google's recommendations and drafts an approval-gated budget or bid adjustment. The pattern is clean: CorpusIQ reads the business, Ryze acts on the ads account with the operator signing off each write.

## Limitations

- Write tools mutate live ad accounts; approval gates are a default, not a guarantee. Review every proposed change.
- Connections are workspace-scoped, so multi-client agencies reconnect per workspace.
- Requires a Claude plan with custom connectors (Pro or above) or a paid ChatGPT plan for connector support.
- The optional Ads Autopilot tier ($89/mo) is where hands-off optimization lives; the free tier is reporting and gated writes only.
