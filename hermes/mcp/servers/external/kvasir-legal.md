# Kvasir Legal MCP - EU Law Grounding

## What It Is

Kvasir Legal MCP (`kvasir.legal`) provides AI agents with verifiable access to German, Bavarian, and EU law - delivered as canonical legal objects with cryptographic provenance and pinpoint citations. Legal professionals and compliance teams can query regulations, search case law, and ground AI outputs in authoritative sources rather than hallucinated legal references.

## Tools Available

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Legal search | Full-text search across German/EU law corpus |
| Canonical objects | Structured legal entities with provenance metadata |
| Citation lookup | Pinpoint citation resolution and verification |
| RAG grounding | Retrieval-augmented generation with verified sources |

## Quick Start

```bash
npx mcp-remote https://kvasir.legal/mcp
```

## Business Use Cases

1. **GDPR compliance check**: "What are the exact requirements for data processing consent under GDPR Article 7?"
2. **Contract review**: "Does this clause comply with German commercial code §377?"
3. **Regulatory monitoring**: "Alert me to any new EU AI Act provisions affecting SaaS companies"
4. **Due diligence**: "Check if this vendor's data processing terms align with Bavarian data protection law"

## Limitations

- **EU/German jurisdiction only**: No US, UK, or Asian law coverage
- **Remote-hosted**: API via kvasir.legal
- **German-language primary**: English translations may lag behind German originals
