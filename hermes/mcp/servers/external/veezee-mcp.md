# Veezee MCP Server ★ New (July 16)

Veezee gives AI agents structured access to LinkedIn, Reddit, and X (Twitter) data through a single MCP server. Instead of managing three separate API integrations, operators get one endpoint for cross-platform social intelligence - competitive research, brand monitoring, prospect discovery, and market trend analysis.

**Source:** mcpservers.org (discovered July 16, 2026)
**Category:** Search / Social Media Intelligence
**Author:** VeezeeHQ (community)
**Repo:** github.com/veezeehq/veezee-sdk

## Key Features
- **LinkedIn Data:** Profile information, company pages, job listings, and professional network data for prospect research and competitive intelligence
- **Reddit Data:** Subreddit search, post content, comment threads, and sentiment analysis across communities for market research
- **X (Twitter) Data:** Tweet search, user profiles, trending topics, and engagement metrics for brand monitoring
- **Unified MCP Interface:** All three platforms through a single MCP server - no separate API keys or SDKs
- **AI-Native Design:** Built for AI agents to query and analyze social data programmatically without browser automation

## Business Relevance

Essential for operators who need cross-platform social intelligence without maintaining three separate API integrations. Veezee consolidates LinkedIn (professional intelligence), Reddit (community sentiment), and X (real-time discourse) into one AI-accessible endpoint.

**Use cases:**
- Competitive analysis across LinkedIn, Reddit, and X in one query
- Brand monitoring - track mentions and sentiment across all three platforms
- Prospect discovery - find leads on LinkedIn, validate interest on Reddit, check activity on X
- Market research - aggregate community sentiment from Reddit with professional context from LinkedIn
- Content strategy - identify trending topics across platforms before creating content

## Integration with CorpusIQ

Veezee complements CorpusIQ's 40+ business connectors by adding social media intelligence. Pair Veezee's social data with CorpusIQ's CRM (HubSpot), analytics (GA4), and email (Gmail) for full-funnel operator intelligence:

```
Veezee → Discover prospects on LinkedIn/Reddit/X
CorpusIQ CRM → Enrich with HubSpot contact data
CorpusIQ Analytics → Track website engagement from social referrals
CorpusIQ Email → Outreach to discovered prospects
```

## Limitations
- Community project - not an official LinkedIn, Reddit, or X API
- SDK-based (not a standalone server) - may require wrapper for direct MCP use
- Rate limits depend on underlying platform APIs
- Data freshness varies by platform cache
- No historical archive - real-time and recent data only
