# hermoso MCP Server - AI Ad Studio

**Repo:** [hermoso-ai/hermoso](https://github.com/hermoso-ai/hermoso)
**Install:** `npx -y hermoso mcp`
**Hosted endpoint:** `app.hermoso.ai/mcp`
**Pricing:** Free signup grant, no card required
**Tools:** 52
**Category:** Marketing / Advertising

## Overview

hermoso is an AI ad studio built for agents. It enables AI assistants to generate finished video, image, and UGC avatar ads for any brand - complete with script writing, voiceover, music, and brand end cards - plus research competitor ads across the Meta, Google, and LinkedIn ad libraries, as well as TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube organic content.

## Why Business Operators Need This

For a business operator running growth, marketing, and competitive intelligence, hermoso is transformative:

1. **Competitor Ad Research** - Your agent can research what ads competitors are running across Meta, Google, and LinkedIn ad libraries, then synthesize insights about messaging, creative angles, and spend patterns.
2. **UGC Video Generation** - Turn competitive insights into finished UGC-style video ads with AI avatars, voiceover, and branding - all through agent conversation, no editing software needed.
3. **Cross-Platform Analysis** - Analyze organic content performance on TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube alongside paid ads for a complete competitive picture.

**Example operator workflow:** "Research what ads our top 3 competitors are running on Meta and Google this month. Find the highest-performing creative angles. Generate 5 UGC-style video ads for our product using those insights. Include a brand end card with our logo and website."

## Common Queries

### Competitor Ad Research

```
"Search the Meta Ad Library for ads from [competitor] running in the last 30 days. Focus on video ads."
"Find the top-performing Google Ads from [industry] brands this quarter."
"Analyze LinkedIn Sponsored Content from [competitor] - what messaging angles are they using?"
```

### UGC Ad Generation

```
"Generate a 30-second UGC-style video ad for our product. Use a casual, testimonial tone. Include our logo as an end card."
"Create 3 variations of a Facebook image ad for our summer promotion. A/B test friendly."
"Make a TikTok-style UGC ad with an AI avatar explaining our value prop in 15 seconds."
```

### Cross-Platform Analysis

```
"Compare our organic Instagram content performance against [competitor]'s last 20 posts."
"What YouTube ad formats are working best in our category? Search 10 competitor channels."
```

## Best Practices

1. **Start with research before generation** - Use the ad library tools to understand competitor creative before generating your own.
2. **Batch generate variations** - Generate 5-10 UGC variations at once for A/B testing on Meta/Google.
3. **Use brand end cards consistently** - Upload your brand assets once, then all generated ads include your branding automatically.
4. **Combine organic + paid insights** - Cross-reference ad library data with organic content performance for complete competitive intelligence.
5. **Iterate fast** - The free signup grant lets you generate multiple rounds without cost concern. Test, learn, regenerate.

## Limitations

- New server (created July 2026) - API stability and tool coverage may evolve rapidly
- Video generation quality depends on AI model capabilities - review outputs before publishing
- Ad library data availability varies by platform (Meta most comprehensive, LinkedIn limited)
- Free tier may have usage caps - check current limits at `app.hermoso.ai`
