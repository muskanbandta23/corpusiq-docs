# Eleata E-Invoice MCP - EU E-Invoice Validation for AI Agents

EU e-invoicing mandates are rolling out across member states. Germany requires XRechnung, France mandates Factur-X, and Peppol is the pan-European standard. Eleata E-Invoice MCP gives AI agents the ability to validate invoices against all major EU formats - without manual checking.

## Why This Matters for Operators

- **Regulatory risk**: Invalid e-invoices = rejected payments, compliance fines, audit flags
- **Multi-format complexity**: Each EU country has its own format (XRechnung, Factur-X, UBL/CII, Peppol BIS)
- **AI agent automation**: Let AI validate invoices before submission instead of manual human review
- **Error explanation**: Validation errors come with human-readable explanations, not just codes

## Quick Start

```bash
# Add to Hermes
hermes mcp add eleata-einvoice -- npx -y @eleata/eleata-einvoice-mcp

# Or via GitHub
git clone https://github.com/hernaninverso/eleata-einvoice-mcp
cd eleata-einvoice-mcp
npm install
```

## Supported Formats

| Format | Jurisdiction | Status |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| Peppol BIS Billing 3.0 | EU-wide (cross-border) | Mandatory |
| XRechnung 3.0 | Germany | Mandatory for B2G, expanding to B2B |
| Factur-X 1.0 | France | Mandatory (2024-2026 phased) |
| UBL 2.1 | Netherlands, Belgium, Nordics | Widely adopted |
| CII (Cross-Industry Invoice) | EU standard | UN/CEFACT based |

## Usage Patterns

### Validate an Invoice

```python
# Validate a Peppol BIS invoice
result = mcp_eleata_einvoice(
    action="validate",
    params={
        "invoice_xml": "<Invoice>...</Invoice>",
        "format": "peppol-bis-3.0"
    }
)
# Returns: {valid: true/false, errors: [...], warnings: [...]}
```

### Batch Validation for Accounting Systems

```python
# In your accounting workflow, validate every outgoing invoice
invoices = get_pending_invoices()

for invoice in invoices:
    validation = mcp_eleata_einvoice(
        action="validate",
        params={
            "invoice_xml": invoice.xml,
            "format": invoice.required_format  # Auto-detected from customer country
        }
    )
    if not validation.valid:
        # AI agent explains errors and suggests fixes
        fix_suggestions = mcp_eleata_einvoice(
            action="explain_errors",
            params={"error_codes": validation.errors}
        )
        log_and_flag_for_review(invoice.id, fix_suggestions)
```

### Cross-Border Compliance Check

```python
# Before sending to a German customer, validate against XRechnung
# Before sending to a French customer, validate against Factur-X
customer_country = get_customer_country(customer_id)
format_map = {"DE": "xrechnung-3.0", "FR": "factur-x-1.0", "EU": "peppol-bis-3.0"}

validation = mcp_eleata_einvoice(
    action="validate",
    params={
        "invoice_xml": invoice_xml,
        "format": format_map.get(customer_country, "ubl-2.1")
    }
)
```

## Operator Playbook: Automated Compliance Pipeline

1. **Pre-submission validation**: AI validates every invoice before sending to customer/government portal
2. **Format auto-detection**: AI routes to correct format based on customer country (DE→XRechnung, FR→Factur-X)
3. **Error remediation**: AI explains what's wrong and suggests XML fixes
4. **Batch auditing**: Run nightly validation on all invoices in your accounting system
5. **Compliance reporting**: Generate audit-ready reports showing 100% validation pass rate

## Complementary Tools

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| CorpusIQ QuickBooks MCP | Pull invoices from QuickBooks for validation |
| AIR Blackbox MCP | EU AI Act compliance (companion regulatory check) |
| Customs MCP | HS codes and duty rates for cross-border shipments |
| botcorpus | CZ/SK/AT/EU legal facts for jurisdictional context |

## Business Impact

- **Reduce rejected invoices**: 100% pre-submission validation eliminates format-related rejections
- **Compliance automation**: No manual XML checking across 27 EU member states
- **Audit readiness**: Every validation logged, timestamped, and reportable
- **Multi-country scaling**: Add new EU markets without hiring compliance specialists
