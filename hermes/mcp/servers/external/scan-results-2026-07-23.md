## Highlight: hermoso - AI Ad Studio for Agents

**Repo:** [hermoso-ai/hermoso](https://github.com/hermoso-ai/hermoso)
**Install:** `npx -y hermoso mcp` or hosted at `app.hermoso.ai/mcp`

This is the highest-value business-operator MCP server discovered this scan. 52 tools for:
- Generating finished video, image, and UGC avatar ads for any brand
- Script writing, voiceover, music, brand end cards
- Competitor ad research across Meta, Google, and LinkedIn ad libraries
- TikTok/Instagram/YouTube organic content analysis
- Free signup grant, no card required

**Operator use case:** A business operator can tell their AI agent "Research what ads our top 3 competitors are running on Meta and Google, then generate 5 UGC-style video ads for our product using those insights." The agent researches via hermoso, generates the ads, and delivers finished MP4 files - all in one workflow.
