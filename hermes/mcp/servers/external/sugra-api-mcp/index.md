# Sugra API MCP

**Official MCP server** giving AI agents source-attributed access to 1,500+ endpoints across 36 data domains from 160+ primary sources. Covers markets, economics, company fundamentals, government, news, climate, and more.

## Why It Matters for Operators

Sugra API MCP is one of the most comprehensive data MCP servers yet - it gives AI agents structured access to an enormous range of business-critical data through a single MCP connection. Think of it as a Bloomberg Terminal for AI agents, but broader: not just markets, but company data, economic indicators, government statistics, news, and climate data - all source-attributed.

For CorpusIQ operators, this means your AI agent can:
- Pull real-time market and economic data alongside your QuickBooks/Stripe financials
- Research company fundamentals during competitive analysis
- Cross-reference government data with your internal business metrics
- Get source-attributed news context for investment or strategic decisions

## CorpusIQ Integration

Sugra API MCP complements CorpusIQ's 40+ business connectors by providing external market and economic context. Use cases:

1. **Competitive Analysis:** Pull company fundamentals + market data alongside your internal financials

## Limitations

- Requires API key from Sugra Systems (apply at sugra.io)
- 1,500+ endpoints is a lot - use tool filtering in your MCP client to avoid context bloat
- New server (1 star, July 2026) - API stability not yet proven at scale
- Remote only (no local/stdio option) - requires internet connectivity
