# Setell MCP Server

Setell is a vertical quote-to-cash agent purpose-built for small service businesses - machine shops, contractors, field service providers, and trades. The MCP server exposes the full Setell platform to AI agents, enabling quote generation, order management, and payment tracking from any MCP-compatible client.

## Why This Matters for Operators

Service businesses run on quotes and invoices. The gap between "a client asks for a quote" and "the invoice is paid" is where most small operators lose time and money. Setell closes this loop with AI-native tooling - your agent can receive a service request, generate a quote from historical pricing data, send it to the client, and track through to payment, all within the MCP ecosystem.

## Installation

```bash
# Via npm
npm install -g setell-mcp

# Or run directly
npx setell-mcp
```

## Claude Desktop / Hermes Configuration

```json

  "mcpServers": {

      "args": ["setell-mcp"],

}
```

## Key Tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `create_quote` | Generate a priced quote from service templates and historical data |
| `list_quotes` | Browse active and past quotes with status filters |
| `convert_to_order` | Convert an accepted quote into a work order |
| `track_payment` | Check payment status on outstanding invoices |
| `get_customer_history` | Retrieve quote and order history for a specific client |

## Authentication

Requires a Setell account and API key. Sign up at [go.setell.ai](https://go.setell.ai).

## CorpusIQ Angle

Setell's quote-to-cash workflow mirrors what CorpusIQ operators do daily - but focused on service businesses rather than e-commerce/DTC. Worth monitoring as a potential partnership target or competitive signal. The vertical AI agent model (specialized MCP servers for industry verticals) is a pattern CorpusIQ can replicate for e-commerce operators.
