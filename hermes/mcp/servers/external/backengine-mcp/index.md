# Backengine MCP Server ★ New (July 18)

## Overview

Backengine is the customer-context layer for revenue teams, now available through MCP. It ingests all of an organization's customer interactions - Slack messages, emails, call transcripts, support tickets - and surfaces relevant context when an AI agent needs it. Instead of asking "what do we know about this customer," your AI assistant already knows. Built by BackEngine AI at `BackEngine-ai/backengine-mcp`.

**Key advantage: AI agents get the full customer picture before every sales conversation - no more digging through Slack, email, and tickets manually.**

## Key Features

- **Unified customer context**: Aggregates customer interactions from Slack, email, call transcripts, and support tickets into a single queryable layer
- **Multi-tenant SaaS**: Designed for organizations - each team gets isolated customer context with role-based access
- **Proactive context surfacing**: AI agents pull relevant history automatically when a customer is mentioned, eliminating manual research
- **Remote MCP**: Connect via Streamable HTTP - no local installation or data syncing required

## Installation

```bash
# Remote MCP - no installation needed
# Add directly to your MCP client config:

# For local dev / self-hosted:
git clone https://github.com/BackEngine-ai/backengine-mcp.git
cd backengine-mcp
npm install
```

## Configuration

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "backengine": {
      "url": "https://api.backengine.ai/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer your-backengine-token"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Business Relevance

- **Sales teams**: Before every call, ask your AI "what's the latest on Acme Corp?" - get Slack threads, recent emails, open support tickets, and last call summary in one response
- **Customer success managers**: Monitor account health by asking "show me all support tickets for Enterprise accounts this week" - Backengine surfaces the context without logging into 5 different tools
- **Revenue operations**: Give every sales rep an AI assistant that already knows the customer history - reduces onboarding time and improves first-call quality
- **Founders doing sales**: Replace the "let me check Slack/email/Intercom" scramble before customer calls with a single AI query

## Integration with CorpusIQ

Backengine pairs powerfully with CorpusIQ's CRM and communication connectors. Feed Backengine's customer context into CorpusIQ's HubSpot or Salesforce connectors to enrich CRM records automatically - every Slack thread, support ticket, and email interaction becomes part of the customer record without manual data entry.

For support-heavy operators, combine Backengine with CorpusIQ's Stripe connector to overlay billing history onto customer context - your AI assistant can answer "why is this customer's usage down?" by cross-referencing support tickets with payment patterns.

## Limitations

- **Repository maturity**: 1 star, 0 forks as of July 2026 - early stage. API contracts may change
- **Cloud-dependent**: Backengine is a multi-tenant SaaS - data leaves your environment. Not suitable for air-gapped or compliance-heavy deployments
- **Integration breadth unclear**: Which specific Slack/email/support systems are supported is not fully documented in the public repo
- **No self-hosted option documented**: Repository is primarily a client - the server-side infrastructure is Backengine's cloud
