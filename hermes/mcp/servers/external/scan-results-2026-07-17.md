# MCP Server Scan - July 17, 2026

**Sources:** mcp.so (React SPA, text extraction) + mcpservers.org (TanStack Router hydration payload)
**Date:** July 17, 2026
**Previous scan:** July 16, 2026
**Coverage:** July 17 new submissions on both platforms

## Methodology

Both sources remain accessible via curl text-stripping from SPA payloads. Cross-referenced all candidates against the existing catalog (index.md + 100+ guide files + prior scan reports including July 16).

## New Servers Found: 10 total, 3 guides created

## Landmark Finding: 1Password MCP

The 1Password MCP server represents a watershed moment for AI agent infrastructure:

1. **First major security platform to ship MCP:** 1Password is the first tier-1 infrastructure provider to release an official MCP server. This signals that MCP has crossed the enterprise adoption threshold.

2. **Novel security architecture:** 1Password's design - where the agent manages secrets without ever reading them - establishes a new pattern for secure agent operations. This "orchestrate, don't access" model will likely be replicated across the industry.

3. **Enterprise MCP tipping point:** When 1Password ships MCP, it validates the protocol for security-conscious enterprises. Expect AWS, HashiCorp, and Azure to follow within months.

4. **Operator implications:** For CorpusIQ's target audience (business operators), 1Password MCP solves a critical blocker to AI agent adoption: how to give agents operational autonomy without compromising security.

## Trends (Updated)

1. **Enterprise MCP adoption accelerates:** 1Password joins Atlassian, GitHub, Cloudflare, Supabase, Google, Notion, and Linear as major platforms with official MCP servers. The "official MCP server" is becoming table stakes for developer platforms.

2. **Security category opens:** 1Password MCP creates the "Security for AI" MCP category. Currently unoccupied by competitors - significant opportunity for security vendors.

3. **Agent security becomes a product category:** As agents become more autonomous, the gap between "what agents can do" and "what agents should be allowed to do" becomes a product surface. 1Password is first to market.
