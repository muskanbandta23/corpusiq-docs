# PreVibe MCP

**A hosted MCP connector that puts PreVibe's product research suite inside your AI apps - validate a SaaS idea with market, competitor, and audience research before you build it - with Google sign-in and no API keys to copy.** The connector plugs into Claude, Cursor, and other MCP clients against your PreVibe account, and access can be revoked from the PreVibe dashboard at any time.

```
Server type: Remote (Streamable HTTP), hosted
Auth: Google sign-in OAuth (no API keys)
Endpoint: https://previbe.io/api/mcp
Tools: Research suite tied to your PreVibe account (market, competitor, audience research)
Pricing: PreVibe account plans (free tier available)
Category: Business Operations / Market Research
Built by: PreVibe (previbe.io)
```

## Why This Matters for Operators

The lean-startup loop says validate before you build, but the validation step - market size, competitor landscape, audience research - is weeks of manual work, which is exactly why it gets skipped. PreVibe compresses it: the research lives in your account, and the MCP connector makes an agent able to run those research passes and read the results inside the same conversation where the product decision is being made.

The zero-key auth matters for adoption: Google sign-in on first connect, no token management, and revocation stays in the account dashboard. For founders and operators who already keep an AI assistant in their workflow, research becomes a step in the conversation instead of a separate tool subscription.

**Market validation becomes a conversation step - research runs from the same chat where the build decision happens.**

## Tools & Capabilities

Capability-level from the vendor's connector page and product docs; exact tool names are exposed after signing in (the connector requires account auth, and anonymous enumeration is not published).

| Capability area | What the agent can do |
|---|---|
| Market research | Run market-sizing and landscape passes for a product idea |
| Competitor research | Map competitor offerings and positioning |
| Audience research | Profile target audiences and needs |
| Saved research | Read and continue research stored in your PreVibe account |

## Installation

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http previbe https://previbe.io/api/mcp
```

The PreVibe MCP Connector page (previbe.io/mcp) has the per-client install guide. On first connect, sign in with Google - no API keys are involved.

## Configuration

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "previbe": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://previbe.io/api/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

Connected apps are listed in the PreVibe account and can be revoked individually from the dashboard.

## Business Relevance

- **Founders pre-build** run validation passes before committing engineering time.
- **Product operators** keep a standing research loop in their assistant for feature and positioning decisions.
- **Agencies** run client discovery research through their own PreVibe account with per-client projects.
- **Teams avoiding another tool** get research inside the AI app they already use, no new login flow.

## Integration with CorpusIQ

PreVibe's research pairs with CorpusIQ's post-launch data to close the validate-then-measure loop: PreVibe answers "should we build this" with market and competitor research, and CorpusIQ connectors (GA4, Stripe, Shopify) answer "is it working" with signup and revenue attribution. A CorpusIQ workflow can hold both sides of a feature decision in one review - the PreVibe validation pass from before launch and the connector data from after - so the team sees the whole arc of a bet, from research to results.

## Limitations

- Brand new listing - first sweep August 29, 2026.
- Account-gated; no anonymous or API-key mode - Google sign-in required.
- Research quality depends on PreVibe's data sources; treat outputs as inputs to judgment.
- Exact tool names are not published publicly; the surface is discovered after sign-in.
