# JaxSuite AI MCP

**AI-native cold outreach and CRM platform with built-in deliverability, a 300M+ verified B2B contact database, and an MCP server that lets AI agents run campaigns end to end.**

```
Server type: Remote (Streamable HTTP)
Auth: API token (Bearer)
Endpoint: https://www.jaxsuite.com/api/v1/mcp
Rate limit: 20 calls/hour, 100 calls/day per token
Category: Sales / Cold Outreach / CRM
```

## Why This Matters for Operators

Cold outreach is the highest-ROI growth channel for B2B operators, but running it effectively requires juggling: contact databases, email verification, content writing, campaign management, deliverability monitoring, and analytics. JaxSuite AI MCP consolidates all of this into 27 tools that AI agents can orchestrate - no browser tab needed.

This is the first end-to-end cold outreach MCP server with built-in deliverability infrastructure. Combined with [LinkedIn MCP (GTM API)](/hermes/mcp/servers/external/linkedin-mcp-gtm/) and [Apollo.io MCP](/hermes/mcp/servers/external/apollo-io-mcp/), operators can build fully autonomous B2B outbound pipelines.

2. **Generate API token** from Settings → API in your JaxSuite dashboard
3. **Add config** to your MCP client

## Use Cases for Business Operators

- **B2B SaaS founders**: Run outbound sequences without a sales team
- **Agencies**: Manage multiple client outreach campaigns from one AI agent
- **Growth operators**: A/B test email sequences at scale
- **Fractional sales leaders**: Delegate campaign execution to AI agents

## Rate Limits

- 20 calls per hour per token
- 100 calls per day per token
- Workspace-scoped (token only accesses your team's data)

## Limitations

- Brand new server (August 2026) - API may evolve
- Rate limits may constrain high-volume operators
- Not open source (commercial SaaS product)
- Requires paid JaxSuite plan (pricing details on their website)
