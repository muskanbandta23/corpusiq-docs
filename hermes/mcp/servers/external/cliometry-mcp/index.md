# Cliometry MCP

**Remote MCP server (Streamable HTTP, no auth)** - Cliometry exposes measured Korean market data as MCP tools: values a model cannot derive on its own, already computed daily, in structured form. Four read-only tools covering the SK Hynix ADR premium, realized leverage multiples, the VIX regime, and Korean semiconductor relative rotation.

```
Server type: Remote (Streamable HTTP)
Auth: None
Endpoint: https://mcp.cliometry.com
Tools: 4 (read-only, pre-computed daily)
Pricing: free
Category: Finance
Built by: Cliometry (cliometry.com) - data CC BY 4.0
```

## Why This Matters for Operators

Market-measurement questions are where models hallucinate most confidently: a model knows what an ADR premium is, but it does not know today's number for KRX:000660, and it cannot compute a 252-trading-day decomposition from memory. Cliometry answers exactly those gaps with mechanical decompositions of past realized returns and daily-accumulated Korean series, delivered structured so no parsing is needed.

**Every response carries its own source URL, as-of date, and stated limits** - the evidence-handle pattern done right for market data. The realized-multiple tool withholds its ratio when the benchmark return is near zero because the ratio diverges there, and the VIX tool returns a fixed-threshold regime label (calm / watch / fear) that explicitly does not forecast direction. The service states plainly that it is delayed reference data for research and education, not investment advice.

## Tools & Capabilities

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `get_realized_multiple` | How many times a leveraged or inverse ETF actually moved versus its daily target, over 20/60/252-day windows - KODEX Leverage, KODEX 200 Futures Inverse 2X, SOXL, TQQQ |
| `get_adr_premium` | SK Hynix ADR (SKHY) premium or discount versus the Seoul-listed share (KRX:000660), converted to KRW |
| `get_vix_band` | CBOE VIX close with a fixed-threshold regime label |
| `get_sector_rrg` | Relative Rotation Graph snapshot for Korean semiconductor-related sectors - relative-strength ratio, momentum, quadrant |

## Installation

```bash
claude mcp add cliometry --transport http https://mcp.cliometry.com
```

No key, no account, no OAuth. One tool ships an interactive MCP Apps widget (SEP-1865), verified on mobile, web, and desktop clients.

## Configuration

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "cliometry": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://mcp.cliometry.com"
    }
  }
}
```

## Business Relevance

- **Semiconductor supply-chain analysts** get a daily Hynix ADR premium series without building one
- **ETF operators** can decompose leverage drift across four leveraged products with one call
- **Risk teams** get a current VIX regime label with no dashboard login
- **Korea-focused investors** get sector rotation context from a single structured endpoint

## Integration with CorpusIQ

Cliometry slots into the CorpusIQ financial-data stack as the Korea specialist. Operators running market research across the CorpusIQ connectors can treat Cliometry's pre-computed series as structured inputs alongside the cross-source analytics layer: semiconductor-cycle context beside GA4 demand signals, or VIX regime beside Stripe and QuickBooks revenue volatility for planning. Because the server is keyless and free, it works as a standing research tool an agent can query any time a Korea-adjacent question appears, with every reading carrying its source URL for the evidence trail CorpusIQ reporting requires.

## Limitations

- Brand new - no track record yet; submitted to mcp.so August 17, 2026
- Korean market only - no US or other regional coverage
- Delayed reference data, not real-time quotes; explicitly not investment advice
- Four tools only - no screening, backtesting, or portfolio functions
- Free service with no SLA; treat as research convenience, not a trading dependency
