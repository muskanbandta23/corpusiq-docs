# SaferAgenticAI MCP - AI Safety Framework

## What It Is

SaferAgenticAI MCP (`NellInc/SaferAgenticAI`) brings the Safer Agentic AI safety framework to coding assistants over the Model Context Protocol. It enforces governance guardrails, safety checks, and policy constraints on agent actions - ensuring agentic workflows comply with organizational safety policies before executing tool calls, file operations, or external API requests.

## Tools Available

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Safety check | Pre-execution validation of agent actions against policy |
| Policy enforcement | Rule-based guardrails for tool calls and code execution |
| Audit logging | Record of all safety decisions and policy violations |

## Quick Start

```bash
uvx saferagenticai-mcp
```

## Business Use Cases

1. **Production agent guardrails**: Deploy Hermes agents in production with safety checks on file writes, network calls, and tool invocations
2. **Compliance enforcement**: Ensure agents never access PII, write to restricted directories, or call unapproved APIs
3. **Multi-agent governance**: Apply consistent safety policies across all agent instances in a team
4. **Audit trail**: Every safety decision logged for SOC 2, HIPAA, or internal compliance review

## Limitations

- **Research-stage**: Part of the NellInc research repository - not yet production-hardened
- **Coding assistant focus**: Primarily designed for coding agents (Codex, Claude Code); may need adaptation for business operations agents
- **No remote transport**: Local-only via `uvx`
