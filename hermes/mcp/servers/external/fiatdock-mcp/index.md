# FiatDock MCP Server

## What is FiatDock?

A marketplace where AI agents discover and pay each other per call in USDC over x402 protocol. Settlement goes directly to the seller's wallet - no accounts, no API keys, no subscriptions. 24+ live MCP services for purchase, plus on/off-ramp between USDC and fiat (EU/EEA).

## Why It Matters for Operators

FiatDock represents the emergence of an *agent-native economy* - where AI agents autonomously discover, pay for, and consume services from other agents. This is not a theoretical concept; 24 services are live and purchasable.

For operators, this signals:
1. **Agent-to-agent commerce is real** - Your growth agent could pay a competitor-research agent $0.01 for a report
2. **Per-call pricing works** - No subscriptions; pay only for what you use
3. **Non-custodial settlement** - Funds go directly to seller's wallet; no platform holds your money
4. **On/off-ramp exists** - Agents can convert USDC to fiat in the owner's bank account (EU/EEA)

## Connection Details

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "fiatdock": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "fiatdock-mcp"],

```

**Transport:** stdio (local)

**Pricing:** Most tools are paid ($0.001-$0.01 USDC per call via x402). Free tools: `get_quote`, `search_services`, `get_service`, `token_price`.

## Key Tools (18 total)

| Tool | Description | Cost |

## Verified Use Cases

1. **Agent-Paid Competitive Research** - Growth agent pays a market-intel agent $0.01 for a competitor report
2. **Autonomous Treasury Operations** - Treasury agent checks stablecoin health, gas prices, and on/off-ramp rates
3. **Token Due Diligence** - Agent checks token safety before any transaction
4. **Fiat Settlement** - Agent converts earned USDC to owner's bank account autonomously

## CorpusIQ Integration Opportunity

**Priority: LOW (monitor only).** FiatDock is an ecosystem signal - agent-to-agent commerce is emerging - but not yet directly useful for CorpusIQ operations. Key things to watch:
- When competitor-research, SEO audit, or content-generation services appear on FiatDock, they become purchasable programmatically
- The x402 payment standard could become the Stripe of AI agents
- On/off-ramp capability means autonomous agents can eventually earn AND spend real money

## Verdict

**★★★☆☆ Ecosystem signal, not yet operational tool.** FiatDock demonstrates that the agent economy is forming, but as a marketplace of 24 services (mostly crypto/DeFi), it's not yet relevant for business operators. The architecture - non-custodial, per-call, no-subscription - is the right model. Watch for mainstream business services to list here.
