# FXMacroData MCP

MCP server providing AI agents with real-time macroeconomic and foreign exchange intelligence - central bank announcements, Commitment of Traders (COT) data, economic calendars, commodity prices, and forex rates across 18 currencies.

## What It Does

- **FX Rates:** Real-time and historical exchange rates for 18 major currencies
- **Central Bank Calendar:** Upcoming policy meetings, interest rate decisions, and minutes
- **COT Data:** Weekly Commitment of Traders reports - positioning data from futures markets
- **Economic Calendar:** GDP, CPI, employment, PMI, and other macro releases with forecasts
- **Commodities:** Gold, oil, copper, and agricultural commodity prices
- **Cross-Rate Analysis:** Calculate implied rates and arbitrage opportunities

## Why It Matters for Operators

Before FXMacroData MCP, an operator managing international payments, import/export pricing, or currency exposure would need:
1. A Bloomberg Terminal ($2,000+/month) or
2. Multiple separate data sources (TradingView for rates, ForexFactory for calendar, CFTC for COT, investing.com for commodities)

Now: AI agent queries everything conversationally:
```
Agent: "What's the EUR/USD outlook given the ECB meeting next week and current COT positioning?"
→ FXMacroData returns rate + ECB calendar + COT data → AI synthesizes answer
```

For operators running e-commerce, SaaS with international pricing, or any business with FX exposure, this turns your AI agent into a treasury analyst.

## Data Sources

FXMacroData aggregates from official sources:
- **FX Rates:** European Central Bank (ECB) reference rates + market feeds
- **COT Data:** Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) - weekly, released Fridays
- **Economic Calendar:** National statistics offices + consensus forecasts
- **Central Bank Calendar:** Official announcements from each central bank
- **Commodities:** LME, CME, ICE exchange data

All data is timestamped and source-cited in API responses.

## Limitations

- **Not real-time tick data:** FX rates have ~1-5 minute delay on Free/Pro tiers. Business tier offers real-time streaming.
- **COT data is weekly:** CFTC releases COT every Friday for the preceding Tuesday. Not suitable for intraday positioning analysis.
- **18 currencies:** Covers all major and most EM currencies but not every currency pair. Exotic pairs require Enterprise.
- **No trade execution:** This is a data server only. For trading, pair with Capital.com MCP or similar execution platforms.
