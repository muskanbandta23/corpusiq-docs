# AICryptoVault MCP - Crypto Treasury for AI Agents

## What It Is

AICryptoVault MCP (`browtastic/cloudaiwallet-mcp-servers`) is MCP-native treasury infrastructure that lets AI agents interact with crypto wallets - query balances, review transaction history, and execute agent-governed DeFi operations. Designed for organizations that hold crypto assets and want programmatic, auditable treasury management.

## Tools Available

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Balance query | Check wallet balances across supported chains |
| Transaction history | Retrieve and analyze past transactions |
| DeFi operations | Agent-governed DeFi interactions (staking, swapping) |

## Quick Start

```bash
npx mcp-remote https://agent.cloudaiwallet.com/sse
```

## Business Use Cases

1. **Treasury reporting**: "Show total crypto holdings across all wallets, valued in USD at current prices"
2. **Transaction audit**: "List all outgoing transactions over $10K in the past 30 days"
3. **DeFi yield monitoring**: "What's the current APY on our staked positions across protocols?"

## Limitations

- **Crypto-only**: No fiat treasury management
- **Remote SSE**: Server-Sent Events transport - ensure network stability
- **Early-stage**: Evolving API, security model under active development
- **Agent custody risk**: AI-managed wallets require strong governance guardrails
