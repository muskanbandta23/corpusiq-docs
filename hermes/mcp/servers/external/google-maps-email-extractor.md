# Google Maps Email Extractor MCP Server ★ New (July 2 PM)

## Overview

Google Maps Email Extractor (`the-ai-entrepreneur-ai-hub/google-maps-email-extractor`) is the first Maps-to-leads MCP server - search businesses on Google Maps by category, location, or keyword, and extract verified contact email addresses for outreach. Sales teams, lead generation agencies, and business development operators can build targeted prospect lists directly from AI agents, eliminating the manual copy-paste workflow of "search Maps → visit website → find contact → add to CRM."

**Key advantage**: Maps search → verified email extraction → structured lead output - the entire Maps-to-outreach pipeline in one MCP server.

## Key Features

- **Google Maps search**: Search businesses by category, keyword, location, radius, and rating
- **Verified email extraction**: Extract contact emails from business websites and public listings
- **Lead enrichment**: Business name, address, phone, website, rating, review count, category
- **Bulk extraction**: Process multiple searches in one session - build lead lists at scale
- **Export formats**: Structured JSON output ready for CRM import or CSV export
- **Deduplication**: Automatic duplicate detection across search results

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/the-ai-entrepreneur-ai-hub/google-maps-email-extractor.git
cd google-maps-email-extractor
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Add to Hermes
hermes mcp add google-maps-leads --command "python3" --args "server.py" --workdir "$(pwd)"
```

## Configuration

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "google-maps-leads": {
      "command": "python3",
      "args": ["server.py"],
      "workdir": "/path/to/google-maps-email-extractor",
      "env": {
        "GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY": "your-api-key",
        "MAX_RESULTS_PER_SEARCH": "50",
        "RATE_LIMIT_DELAY": "2"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Business Relevance

- **Local Business Prospecting**: Sales teams targeting local businesses (restaurants, dentists, plumbers, law firms) can build qualified lead lists in minutes instead of hours
- **Market Research**: Analyze business density by category and location - "how many coffee shops within 5 miles of downtown Austin?"
- **Franchise Development**: Identify potential franchise locations by mapping competitor density and business demographics
- **Partnership Outreach**: Find complementary businesses for partnership and cross-promotion - "all yoga studios near our fitness centers"
- **Competitive Intelligence**: Map competitor locations, review scores, and customer sentiment by geography

## Integration with CorpusIQ

Google Maps Email Extractor feeds directly into CorpusIQ's lead generation and outreach stack:

- **Lead Enrichment**: Maps leads → enrich with Versium Reach or SyncGTM for additional firmographic and contact data
- **CRM Ingestion**: Extracted leads → auto-create contacts in Attio, OnePageCRM, or any CorpusIQ-connected CRM
- **Outreach Automation**: Lead list → personalized email sequences (Gmail/Outlook) → SMS follow-up (VoIP.ms MCP) → meeting scheduling (Cal.com)
- **Competitive Analysis**: Combine with IndustryLens for competitive intelligence - maps data + competitive reports = complete market picture
- **Pre-flight Gate**: CorpusIQ's pre-flight gate validates email addresses before sending - reduces bounce rates and protects sender reputation

## Limitations

- Email extraction accuracy depends on business website quality and contact page availability
- Google Maps API rate limits apply - high-volume extraction may require API quota increases
- Self-hosted Python server - requires Python 3.8+ and Google Maps API key
- Email verification is extraction-based, not SMTP-verified (pair with Emailable MCP for verification)
