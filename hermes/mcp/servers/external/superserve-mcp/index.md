# Superserve MCP - Sandbox Infrastructure for AI Agents

**Repository:** [superserve-ai/superserve](https://github.com/superserve-ai/superserve)
**Stars:** 413 ★
**Category:** Infrastructure / Developer Environments
**Language:** TypeScript
**License:** Open source
**Last Updated:** Active (July 2026)

## What It Does

Superserve provides on-demand, isolated cloud sandboxes that AI agents can create, control, and destroy via MCP. Think "Docker containers, but in the cloud, managed by your AI agent." Each sandbox is an ephemeral environment with its own filesystem, network, and compute - perfect for running untrusted code, testing deployments, or giving AI agents a safe playground.

### Key Capabilities

| Capability | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Sandbox Creation** | Spin up isolated cloud sandboxes on demand - specify RAM, CPU, disk |
| **Code Execution** | Run arbitrary code in sandboxed environments - safe for AI-generated code |
| **File System** | Read, write, and manage files within sandboxes |
| **Network Access** | Controlled outbound network access from sandboxes |
| **Lifecycle Management** | Create, pause, resume, and destroy sandboxes via MCP tools |
| **Multi-Tenant Isolation** | Each sandbox is fully isolated - no cross-contamination between agents or users |

## Why Business Operators Care

- **Safe AI code execution:** Delegate code generation and execution to AI agents without risking your production environment
- **Customer demos:** Spin up live, isolated environments for each prospect - no shared state
- **Testing automation:** AI agents can provision test environments, run integration tests, and destroy them automatically
- **Cost control:** Pay only for sandbox uptime - ephemeral by design, no idle infrastructure costs

## Setup for Hermes Agent

### Prerequisites

- Superserve account (create at [superserve.ai](https://superserve.ai))
- API key from Superserve dashboard

### MCP Configuration

Add to `~/.hermes/config.yaml`:

```yaml
mcp_servers:
  superserve:
    type: stdio
    command: npx
    args:
      - "@superserve/mcp"
    env:
      SUPERSERVE_API_KEY: "${SUPERSERVE_API_KEY}"
```

Or via the Superserve CLI:

```bash
# Install CLI
npm install -g @superserve/cli

# Login
superserve login

# The MCP server reads auth from ~/.superserve/config.json
```

### MCP Configuration (CLI-based):

```yaml
mcp_servers:
  superserve:
    type: stdio
    command: superserve
    args:
      - mcp
      - serve
```

## Common Queries via Hermes

Once configured, ask Hermes:

- "Create a sandbox with Node.js 20 installed and run this script"
- "Spin up 5 identical sandboxes for load testing - run the test script in each"
- "Show me all active sandboxes and their resource usage"
- "Destroy all sandboxes older than 1 hour"
- "Create a sandbox with a PostgreSQL database for integration testing"

## Comparison: Superserve vs Devopness vs Docker

| Feature | Superserve MCP | Devopness MCP | Docker (local) |
|---------|---------------|---------------|----------------|
| **Environment type** | Ephemeral sandbox | Production deployment | Local container |
| **Isolation** | Cloud-level (full VM) | Cloud-level (credential isolation) | Process-level |
| **Persistence** | Ephemeral (destroyed on command) | Persistent (app stays deployed) | Persistent (container stays) |
| **Cost model** | Per-second sandbox uptime | Per-deployment / free tier | Free (local resources) |
| **Network** | Controlled outbound only | Full cloud networking | Host network |
| **Best for** | Testing, demos, code execution | Production deployments, CI/CD | Local development |

**Verdict:** Superserve for ephemeral/test workloads, Devopness for production deployments, Docker for local dev. These three form a complementary stack: develop locally (Docker), test in isolation (Superserve), deploy to production (Devopness).

## Security Model

- **Complete isolation:** Each sandbox runs in its own virtualized environment - no shared kernel, no shared filesystem
- **Ephemeral by default:** Sandboxes auto-destroy after a configurable TTL (default: 1 hour)
- **Network controls:** Outbound network access is allowlisted - sandboxes can't reach your internal network
- **Resource limits:** CPU, RAM, and disk are capped per sandbox - no runaway costs

## Pitfalls

1. **Cold start latency:** Sandbox creation takes 5-15 seconds - not suitable for sub-second response workflows
2. **State is ephemeral:** Anything not explicitly saved/persisted is lost when the sandbox is destroyed. Design workflows to export results.
3. **Cost accumulation:** Multiple agents creating sandboxes can accumulate costs quickly. Set TTL limits and budget alerts.
4. **Not for persistent workloads:** Superserve is designed for ephemeral use - for persistent deployments, use Devopness or direct cloud provisioning.
