# MCP Server Scan - July 21, 2026

**Sources:** mcpservers.org /all page (10,079+ servers), awesome-mcp-servers PR queue (punkpeye/awesome-mcp-servers), mcp.so (unreachable - 502)
**Date:** July 21, 2026, 03:02 MST
**Previous scan:** [July 20 Sweep](/hermes/mcp/servers/external/scan-results-2026-07-19/) (last scan-results file)
**Coverage:** New submissions since July 20 sweep

## Methodology

Web tools (Firecrawl) unavailable on this node. GitHub search (`gh search repos`) blocked with "User flagged as spammy" on all date-filtered queries. Used:

1. **awesome-mcp-servers PR queue** - `gh api repos/punkpeye/awesome-mcp-servers/pulls?state=closed` - **zero merged PRs since July 13**
2. **mcpservers.org /all page** - SSR extraction via Python urllib (Accept-Encoding: identity); 30 newest-listed servers extracted
3. **Cross-reference** - All candidates checked against existing catalog (169 entries in `servers/external/`)

## Key Finding: mcpservers.org Direct Submissions Outpacing awesome-mcp-servers PRs

The mcpservers.org directory accepts direct submissions via `/submit` (free + premium $39 tier) that bypass the awesome-mcp-servers PR queue entirely. This creates two discovery vectors:

1. **awesome-mcp-servers PR queue** → merged → appears in both mcp.so AND mcpservers.org (traditional path)
2. **mcpservers.org direct submit** → appears only on mcpservers.org (new path, growing faster)

## Limitations & Next Steps

1. **Full details unavailable:** mcpservers.org server pages return 404 (client-side rendered React/Next.js). Individual server descriptions not extractable without browser automation or Firecrawl.
2. **GitHub repos unknown:** None of these servers appear in the awesome-mcp-servers README (direct submission path). GitHub search blocked. Repo ownership cannot be determined from current node.
3. **Recommendation:** Re-run scan when Firecrawl is available, or use Mac Mini Playwright to scrape mcpservers.org server detail pages. Prioritize: **Feedier, GReminders, BasedOnBusiness, Google Maps Scraper, Scalix Cloud, codicil, LastPing MCP, InvestSights** - these have direct business-operator relevance.

## mcp.so Status

mcp.so returned HTTP 502 on all attempted endpoints (API + web). SPA not accessible. Backend repo `chatmcp/mcpso` (2,025⭐) - no new CorpusIQ issues since #3248 (July 20).

## Repository Health

- **Existing catalog:** 169 server guides + index.md (2,690 lines)
- **Last push:** July 20 sweep - 8 new business-operator MCP servers
- **No new guides created this scan** due to scraping limitations
