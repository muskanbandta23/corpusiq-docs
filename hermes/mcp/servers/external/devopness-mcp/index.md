# Devopness MCP - AI DevOps on Your Cloud

**Repository:** [devopness/devopness](https://github.com/devopness/devopness)
**Stars:** 434 ★
**Category:** DevOps / Cloud Infrastructure
**Language:** TypeScript
**License:** Open source (free plan available)
**Last Updated:** Active (July 2026)

## What It Does

Devopness is an AI-native DevOps platform that lets AI agents (via MCP) deploy applications, provision infrastructure, and manage CI/CD pipelines across any cloud provider - AWS, Azure, GCP, DigitalOcean, and more. The key differentiator: **no cloud credentials are ever exposed to the AI chat**. All operations go through Devopness's deterministic API, which holds credentials server-side.

### Key Capabilities

| Capability | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **App Deployment** | Deploy Node.js, Python, Go, Ruby, PHP, static sites to any cloud |
| **Infrastructure Provisioning** | Create servers, databases, load balancers, storage across AWS/Azure/GCP/DO |
| **CI/CD Pipeline Management** | Create, trigger, and monitor deployment pipelines |
| **Cloud Credential Isolation** | AI agents never see AWS keys or cloud credentials - Devopness holds them |
| **Multi-Cloud Unified API** | Same MCP tools work across all supported clouds |
| **Environments** | Staging, production, and ephemeral environments managed through MCP |

## Why Business Operators Care

- **Deploy without DevOps engineers:** Business operators can deploy apps via natural language - "deploy the Next.js app to AWS with a PostgreSQL database"
- **Credential safety:** Cloud credentials (AWS access keys, Azure service principals) never enter the AI chat context - no accidental leaks
- **Audit trail:** Every deployment, infrastructure change, and pipeline trigger is logged and attributable
- **Multi-cloud from one interface:** AWS, Azure, GCP all through the same MCP tools - no provider-specific CLI learning curve

## Setup for Hermes Agent

### Prerequisites

- Devopness account (free plan at [devopness.com](https://devopness.com))
- API token from Devopness dashboard → Settings → API Tokens

### MCP Configuration

Add to `~/.hermes/config.yaml`:

```yaml
mcp_servers:
  devopness:
    type: stdio
    command: npx
    args:
      - "@devopness/mcp-server"
    env:
      DEVOPNESS_API_TOKEN: "${DEVOPNESS_API_TOKEN}"
```

Or use the Docker image:

```yaml
mcp_servers:
  devopness:
    type: stdio
    command: docker
    args:
      - run
      - -i
      - --rm
      - -e
      - DEVOPNESS_API_TOKEN
      - devopness/mcp-server
    env:
      DEVOPNESS_API_TOKEN: "${DEVOPNESS_API_TOKEN}"
```

### Environment Setup

```bash
# Store token securely (never in chat context)
export DEVOPNESS_API_TOKEN="dop_v1_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"

# Verify connection
npx @devopness/mcp-server --health-check
```

## Common Queries via Hermes

Once configured, ask Hermes:

- "Deploy the main branch to staging on AWS"
- "What servers are running in production and what are their costs?"
- "Create a PostgreSQL database on DigitalOcean for the analytics app"
- "Show me the last 5 deployment logs"
- "Scale the API server from 2 to 4 instances"
- "What CI/CD pipelines failed in the last 24 hours?"

## Comparison: Devopness vs Direct Cloud CLI vs Superserve

| Feature | Devopness MCP | AWS/Azure CLI | Superserve MCP |
|---------|---------------|---------------|----------------|
| **Multi-cloud** | Yes (AWS, Azure, GCP, DO) | Provider-specific | Cloud-agnostic |
| **Credential isolation** | Full - AI never sees keys | Keys in env/config | Sandbox isolation |
| **Deployment** | App + infra + CI/CD | Infra only | Sandbox provisioning |
| **CI/CD** | Built-in pipelines | External (GitHub Actions, etc.) | None |
| **Best for** | Full-stack cloud management | Infrastructure-as-code | Isolated dev environments |
| **Pricing** | Free plan available | Pay-as-you-go | Unknown |

## Security Model

Devopness uses a **credential firewall** architecture:
1. You store cloud credentials in Devopness (not in AI chat or local config)
2. AI agent calls Devopness MCP tools with declarative intents ("deploy app X to staging")
3. Devopness API executes against your cloud using server-side credentials
4. AI agent receives only results and status - never sees or touches credentials

This is complementary to CorpusIQ's read-only external-source retrieval model - CorpusIQ reads business data, Devopness executes infrastructure actions.

## Pitfalls

1. **Free plan limits:** Check deployment concurrency and server count limits on the free tier before production use.
2. **Provider coverage:** Not all cloud services are available - verify your target services (RDS, EKS, AKS) are supported.
3. **State drift:** If infrastructure is modified outside Devopness (via AWS Console, Terraform), the MCP's view may be stale.
4. **Cost visibility:** AI-initiated deployments can create resources that incur costs - set up budget alerts in your cloud provider.
