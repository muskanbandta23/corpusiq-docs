**Research-grade Indian stock market data MCP server.** Covers 6,000+ NSE/BSE stocks with fundamentals, forensic accounting scores, DCF valuation models, screening, real-time prices, and news. Built for serious equity research through AI agents.

## What It Does for Operators

- **Forensic accounting** - Red-flag detection: promoter pledging, related-party transactions, auditor red flags, earnings quality scores
- **DCF valuation** - Built-in discounted cash flow models with customizable assumptions
- **Stock screening** - Multi-parameter screening across fundamentals, valuation, and technicals
- **Real-time prices** - Live NSE/BSE price feeds
- **News integration** - Stock-specific news aggregation

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/InvestSights/investsights-indian-stock-research-mcp.git

## Key Tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `get_fundamentals` | Balance sheet, P&L, cash flow for any NSE/BSE stock |

*Note: Tool names are approximate. See github.com/InvestSights for full API.*

## Operator Use Cases

1. **Indian Market Investors** - Run full research workflows on any NSE/BSE stock through AI agent commands
2. **Portfolio Managers** - Screen the entire Indian market for value opportunities using forensic accounting filters
3. **Equity Analysts** - Generate DCF valuations with documented assumptions for client reports
4. **Family Offices** - Monitor Indian holdings with automated red-flag detection

## CorpusIQ Angle

InvestSights is the first India-focused MCP server and fills a major geographic gap in the MCP financial data ecosystem. Operators with India exposure or supply chains can pair InvestSights (Indian market data) with CorpusIQ (operational data from QuickBooks, Stripe) for holistic India business intelligence.

## Limitations

- India-only coverage (NSE/BSE). No US, EU, or other markets.
- Data sources not fully documented - verify accuracy for production use
- Python-only (no Node/TypeScript version)
- New project - active development, API may change
