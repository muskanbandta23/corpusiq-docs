# ShopSynch MCP - E-Commerce Operations for AI Agents

**Remote MCP server (Streamable HTTP, OAuth 2.1 PKCE)** - the official MCP connector for ShopSynch, a scalable e-commerce API platform covering payments, orders, inventory sync, multi-currency selling and a seller dashboard. Approved AI clients work with a merchant's store through a secure, permission-based connection: store insights, product workflows, order support, customer context, inventory checks and operational reporting. Published as an official connector profile with PKCE and a default `mcp:store` scope.

```
Server type: Remote (Streamable HTTP)
Auth: OAuth 2.1 PKCE (authorization server metadata at api.shopsynch.com)
Endpoint: https://api.shopsynch.com/mcp
Tools: store insights, products, orders, customers, inventory, payments, analytics (served from the endpoint)
Pricing: merchant platform plan; no separate MCP fee published
Category: Commerce & E-Commerce
Built by: ShopSynch
```

## Why This Matters for Operators

Merchants running on ShopSynch get payments, orders and inventory in one platform, and until now the only way to interrogate that platform was the seller dashboard. The MCP connector moves those questions into the assistant the operator already uses: "which orders need attention today", "where is inventory running thin", "what did the store do this week" become chat prompts answered from live store data under the merchant's own permissions.

**The permission model is the point: OAuth 2.1 with PKCE means the merchant grants a scoped, revocable connection instead of handing out a long-lived API key.** The connector profile is published as machine-readable metadata - authorization server, protected resource and default `mcp:store` scope - so client onboarding is a consent flow, not a credential paste. Every action resolves through the signed-in merchant's store permissions, and the vendor states actions that create or change data remain subject to confirmation in the AI client.

For operators this is a low-friction way to let an agent read store health and prepare operations work while the human stays the only one who can commit changes.

## Tools & Capabilities

| Capability area | What an agent can do |
|---|---|
| Store insights | Read store-level performance, sales trends and operational status |
| Product workflows | Work with products: catalog state, listings, and product-level questions |
| Order support | Inspect orders, statuses and fulfillment context for customer conversations |
| Customer context | Pull customer records and history relevant to an order or ticket |
| Inventory checks | Query stock levels and inventory state for planning and restock decisions |
| Payments | Read payment and transaction state for reconciliation questions |
| Operational reporting | Compose store analytics and reporting answers from live data |

The full tool list is served live from the endpoint after the OAuth handshake; the table above follows the vendor's published capability description. Every use case runs under the connected merchant's own permissions.

## Installation

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http shopsynch https://api.shopsynch.com/mcp
```

The client discovers the OAuth 2.1 metadata from the published connector profile, opens the ShopSynch consent screen, and the merchant approves the connection. The same URL works in any client that supports OAuth-protected MCP endpoints.

## Configuration

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "shopsynch": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://api.shopsynch.com/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

No API key appears in client configuration: authentication is the OAuth 2.1 PKCE flow with the default `mcp:store` scope, and the merchant's existing ShopSynch account is the identity.

## Business Relevance

- **ShopSynch merchants** get an agent-accessible view of products, orders, inventory and payments without exporting data or building their own integration
- **Support and ops teams** answer order and customer questions in chat from live store state
- **Store managers** run operational reporting through the assistant instead of dashboard exports
- **Developers and agencies** onboard clients through one consent flow rather than per-account API keys

## Integration with CorpusIQ

ShopSynch complements CorpusIQ by covering a storefront and payments platform that sits alongside the accounting and analytics surfaces CorpusIQ already reads. CorpusIQ's QuickBooks, Stripe, GA4 and Shopify connectors give the financial and marketing picture; ShopSynch MCP gives the store-level operational view (orders, inventory, payments state) for merchants on that platform. A composed workflow: an agent reconciles Stripe settlement data from CorpusIQ against ShopSynch order and payment state, flags mismatches, then drafts the customer-facing explanation - all with writes still gated on human confirmation in both systems.

## Limitations

- New listing (September 2026) - the connector profile is published but there is no long public track record
- Serves ShopSynch merchants only; it is a platform connector, not a multi-channel commerce hub
- No published tool count or pricing dedicated to MCP - the surface is scoped by the merchant plan
- All mutations remain subject to confirmation in the AI client, which adds a step to every write
- No public repository to inspect; the vendor publishes the connector metadata on its docs site
