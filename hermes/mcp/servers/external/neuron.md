## Key Tools (120+ total)

| Tool Category | Examples |
|--------------|----------|
| **Chatbots** | Create, deploy, manage WhatsApp chatbots |
| **Broadcasts** | Send bulk messages, schedule campaigns |
| **Contacts** | Import, segment, manage contact lists |
| **Knowledge Base** | Upload docs, manage Q&A pairs |
| **Newsletters** | Create, schedule, track WhatsApp newsletters |
| **Analytics** | Message delivery, open rates, response tracking |

## Why This Matters for Operators

WhatsApp has 2B+ users and is the #1 business messaging platform in:
- **LATAM** (Brazil, Mexico, Colombia)
- **India** (500M+ users)
- **Southeast Asia** (Indonesia, Philippines)
- **Africa** (Nigeria, South Africa, Kenya)

If you do business in these markets, WhatsApp is not optional - it's where your customers are. Neuron brings WhatsApp automation into your AI agent workflow for the first time.

## Pricing
Check neuron.ng for current pricing. Platform typically offers tiered plans based on message volume and feature set.

## Alternatives
- **Official WhatsApp Business API**: Direct Meta integration (requires business verification, more complex setup)
- **Twilio MCP** (if available): Broader communication platform, WhatsApp is one channel
- **Custom webhook bots**: Build your own, but lose the 120+ pre-built tools

## Security Notes
- API keys provide full account access - store securely
- WhatsApp has strict anti-spam policies - use broadcasts responsibly
- Consider read-only mode for initial testing
- Review Neuron's data handling and privacy policy before connecting production data
