# NaturalMelo MCP - AI Content Detection

## What It Is

NaturalMelo MCP (`carter-wzq/naturalmelo-mcp`) provides lightweight AI content detection - it scores text for "naturalness" (how human it reads), flags common AI-template patterns, and suggests humanization edits. Content teams and marketers can audit AI-assisted content before publishing, ensuring output reads authentically rather than like a generic LLM response.

## Tools Available

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Naturalness score | 0-100 score indicating how "human" the text reads |
| Pattern flagging | Identify AI-template phrases ("delve into", "it's worth noting", etc.) |
| Humanization suggestions | Specific edits to make text sound more natural |

## Quick Start

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY={key} node {path}/naturalmelo-mcp/dist/server.js
```

## Business Use Cases

1. **Content QC**: "Score this blog post for AI detectability before we publish - flag any sections that need rewriting"
2. **Competitive audit**: "Analyze competitor X's last 10 blog posts - are they using AI-generated content? What's their average naturalness score?"
3. **Brand voice compliance**: "Check this AI-drafted email sequence - does it pass our brand voice guidelines for naturalness?"
4. **SEO-safe content**: "Verify this product description won't trigger Google's AI content penalties"

## Limitations

- **OpenAI API dependency**: Uses OpenAI for detection - incurs API costs per query
- **Local-only**: Requires Node.js and local file path configuration
- **Detection accuracy**: AI detection is probabilistic - high scores don't guarantee human authorship
- **Short-text limitation**: Best for 200+ word content; very short snippets produce unreliable scores
