# Launch Fast MCP - Amazon FBA Analytics

## What It Is

Launch Fast MCP (`BlockchainHB/launchfast-mcp`) gives AI agents direct access to Amazon FBA seller tools - product research, seller analytics, Brand Analytics, and advertising diagnostics. Operators can query competitor data, track keyword rankings, analyze ad performance, and research suppliers without leaving their AI assistant. Remote-hosted, zero local setup.

## Tools Available

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Product research | Search products by category, sales rank, revenue estimates |
| Keyword research | Search volume, competition, and ranking data |
| Brand Analytics | Market basket analysis, repeat purchase behavior, demographics |
| Ads diagnostics | Campaign performance, ACOS, impression share |
| Supplier research | Supplier database lookups |
| Rank tracking | Track product/keyword ranking changes over time |

## Quick Start

```bash
npx mcp-remote https://launchfastlegacyx.com/api/mcp/server
```

## Business Use Cases

1. **Product opportunity scan**: "Show me top-selling products in Kitchen & Dining with under 50 reviews and over $20K monthly revenue"
2. **Competitor ad analysis**: "What keywords is competitor X bidding on, and what's their estimated ACOS?"
3. **Inventory planning**: "Which of my products have declining BSR trends - flag restock risks"
4. **Supplier research**: "Find US-based suppliers for stainless steel water bottles with MOQ under 500"
5. **CorpusIQ combo**: Pair Launch Fast's Amazon data with CorpusIQ's Shopify/Stripe data for true multi-channel ecommerce intelligence

## Limitations

- **Amazon-only**: FBA/FBM focused - no Walmart, eBay, or other marketplace support
- **Remote service**: Depends on launchfastlegacyx.com uptime
- **No write-back**: Analytics and research only - no listing management or inventory adjustment
