# Flash Props API MCP Server - Live Sports Props Data

Flash Props API is a hosted remote MCP server for live sports betting player props. It covers NBA, MLB, NFL, NHL, NCAA, and soccer in a unified format - one API for all major sports. Designed for agents that need real-time betting data without managing multiple sports-specific APIs.

## Why This Matters

Sports betting data is traditionally fragmented across league-specific APIs with different formats. Flash Props unifies them into a single MCP interface. For agents building betting models, arbitrage scanners, or sports analytics dashboards, this eliminates the integration tax of connecting to 6+ different data providers.

## Installation

```bash
# Remote MCP - no installation needed
# Connect directly via SSE endpoint:
# https://flash-props-api.example.com/sse
```
