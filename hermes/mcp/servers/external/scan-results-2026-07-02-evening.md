## Trends

- **Travel vertical opens up**: Maqami Travel is the first hotel-booking MCP server - 65 tools across 249 countries signals the travel industry waking up to MCP as a distribution channel. Expect airline, rental car, and experience-booking MCPs to follow.
- **Telephony goes agentic**: VoIP.ms MCP is the first business telephony MCP - phone numbers, SMS, voicemail, call flows, billing. Business communication infrastructure now directly accessible from AI agents.
- **Secure database access**: dbridge MCP takes a different approach from existing database MCPs - security-first with column masking, row caps, and query limits. Addresses the #1 concern operators have about AI agents accessing production databases.
- **Testing infrastructure matures**: Periscope MCP (63 tools) joins Playwright MCP (78 tools) and QA Skills (43 tools) - a dedicated testing tool ecosystem is forming within MCP, distinct from general browser automation.
- **Lead gen specialization**: Google Maps Email Extractor represents a new class of hyper-specific lead gen MCPs - one source, one use case, zero overhead. The "app store" model applied to MCP servers.
- **YouTube MCPs proliferate**: Tubask joins Scribefy and existing YouTube MCPs - hosted approach (vs. self-hosted) lowers the barrier for content operators who don't want to manage infrastructure.
- **pipeworx-io keeps shipping**: mcp-here (HERE Maps) extends the pipeworx suite to 19+ servers, adding location services to the already-comprehensive business data portfolio.
