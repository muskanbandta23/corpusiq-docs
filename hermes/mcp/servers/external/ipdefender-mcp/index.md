# IP Defender MCP - Trademark Monitoring for AI Agents

**Remote MCP server (HTTP, OAuth 2)** - connects an AI assistant to the IP Defender trademark monitoring service so operators can manage brand watches in plain language: create and start monitoring for brands, choose or change watched countries, review alerts, and pause or adjust settings - all under the operator's own IP Defender account. Watches track new trademark filings across 40+ countries and flag applications that resemble the brand. Complementary to filing, not a law firm.

```
Server type: Remote (HTTP)
Auth: OAuth 2 (sign in to IP Defender and allow access)
Endpoint: https://www.ipdefender.eu/mcp
Tools: watches, countries, alerts, pause and settings operations (served from the endpoint)
Pricing: IP Defender subscription; MCP access included
Category: IP/Legal
Built by: IP Defender (ipdefender.eu)
```

## Why This Matters for Operators

Brand impersonation usually starts with a trademark application: someone files a confusingly similar mark in a market you have not entered yet, and by the time you notice, opposition windows have closed. Manual monitoring means paying an attorney or periodically searching registers yourself - and the searches are easy to forget. IP Defender automates the watching and lets the operator's own assistant drive it.

**The assistant stays a helper, not a decision-maker: it works only after the operator connects their account and allows access, and everything it does is the same surface the website exposes - create watches, pick countries, review alerts, pause monitoring.** For an operator who already lives in chat, "watch my brand in the United States and the European Union" and "every Monday, check my alerts and tell me only if something needs action" become standing prompts instead of a quarterly manual routine.

The service is explicit about its scope: it watches filings and flags resemblance; it does not file, oppose or advise - the operator still routes action through counsel, but with the early-warning signal in hand.

## Tools & Capabilities

| Capability | What an agent can do |
|---|---|
| Watch management | Create and start trademark monitoring for a brand; update, pause or stop watches |
| Country selection | Choose or change the countries watched per brand (40+ countries available) |
| Alert review | Read alerts and explain what needs the operator's attention |
| Settings | Adjust account and alert settings through conversation |

The tool list is served live from the endpoint after the OAuth handshake; the table above follows the vendor's published capability description. All operations run against the connected IP Defender account.

## Installation

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http ip-defender https://www.ipdefender.eu/mcp
```

In any assistant, add the address as a connector or custom MCP server, then complete the IP Defender sign-in window and allow access. If the sign-in window is blocked, allow pop-ups for that assistant and retry, then start a new chat so the connection is picked up.

## Configuration

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ip-defender": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://www.ipdefender.eu/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

IP Defender uses MCP for the connection and OAuth 2 for secure sign-in; any assistant supporting both can connect. No API key is pasted into configuration - the operator's IP Defender account is the identity.

## Business Relevance

- **Brand owners** get standing trademark watches across 40+ countries without manual register searches
- **Founders pre-launch** check name risk in target markets before spending on brand assets
- **Ops teams** fold brand monitoring into a weekly assistant check instead of a separate vendor dashboard
- **Legal counsels** receive pre-filtered, brand-similar filings rather than raw register dumps

## Integration with CorpusIQ

IP Defender complements CorpusIQ's operational intelligence with the legal-risk layer operators usually bolt on last. CorpusIQ reads the business - revenue, spend, traffic, customers - while IP Defender watches the brand perimeter. A composed workflow: an agent tracks launch performance through CorpusIQ's GA4 and Stripe connectors, and in the same session checks IP Defender for new filings resembling the brand in expansion markets, then drafts the counsel briefing with the growth numbers attached. No write overlap: CorpusIQ stays read-only and IP Defender's changes stay confirmation-gated by the assistant.

## Limitations

- New MCP surface (September 2026) - monitoring scope is trademark filings, not domains, marketplaces or social impersonation
- No published tool list; capabilities are documented in prose and served live from the endpoint
- Requires an IP Defender subscription for meaningful coverage
- Not a law firm: no filing, opposition or legal advice - alerts still route through counsel
- Watch quality depends on the filing data IP Defender ingests per country
