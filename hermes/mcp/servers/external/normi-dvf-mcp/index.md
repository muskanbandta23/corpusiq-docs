## Why This Matters for Operators

French property prices are one of the few markets with complete, mandatory transaction records - the DVF dataset logs every sale with price, surface and location - but the raw files are quarterly government dumps that require geocoding and a data pipeline to be useful. Normi does that work and exposes the result as eight MCP tools with a credit-based pricing model, so an agent can answer "prix au m2 Paris 15e" or "find comparables for a 65m2 T3 in Lyon 3e" with actual transaction data instead of portal list prices.

For anyone evaluating French property - investors, relocation services, notaries, lenders or agencies - this is the difference between asking a model to guess and asking it to read the official ledger. The REST API (`mcp.normi.fr/v1/...`) is available for non-MCP use cases.

## Tools & Capabilities

| Tool | Description | Credits |
|---|---|---|
| `search_properties` | Search transactions by location, type, price, surface | 5 |
| `get_market_stats` | Aggregate stats: median price, price per m2, volume | 5 |
| `find_comparables` | Find similar properties by proximity and surface | 10 |
| `get_price_trends` | Price evolution over time (month/quarter/year) | 10 |
| `compare_neighborhoods` | Compare 2-5 locations side by side | 10 |
| `get_market_activity` | Transaction volume and seasonality | 10 |
| `get_market_heatmap` | Price data by zone for a department | 15 |
| `get_property_history` | Transaction history for a specific address | 20 |

## Installation

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http normi https://mcp.normi.fr/mcp --header "Authorization: Bearer normi_YOUR_TOKEN"
```

Or local via npx: `npx -y @normi/mcp-dvf` with `NORMI_API_KEY` in the environment.

## Configuration

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "normi": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@normi/mcp-dvf"],
      "env": { "NORMI_API_KEY": "normi_YOUR_TOKEN_HERE" }
    }
  }
}
```

Sign up at normi.fr and create a token in the dashboard. The server is listed in the official MCP Registry.

## Business Relevance

- **Property investors and funds** pull comparables, price-per-m2 trends and neighborhood comparisons from official transaction records, not listings.
- **Relocation and mobility teams** answer cost-of-living and housing-market questions with real data per department.
- **Notaries, lenders and valuers** get address-level transaction history with a documented API and MCP path.
- **Analysts covering French markets** build reproducible market snapshots (median price, volume, seasonality) on a credit-metered budget.
