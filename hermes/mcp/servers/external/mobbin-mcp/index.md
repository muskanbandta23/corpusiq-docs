# Mobbin MCP

**Real product screens, searchable by an agent - so what gets built starts with what already works.** Mobbin is the established screen-reference library (600,000+ screens across top products); its official MCP server exposes three natural-language search tools over that corpus. Results return inline images with metadata, and every screen carries its canonical `mobbin_url` so agent output can cite the source a human can open.

```
Server type: Remote (Streamable HTTP)
Auth: OAuth
Endpoint: https://api.mobbin.com/mcp
Tools: 3 (screen, flow and section search)
Pricing: Mobbin plans (not published on listing)
Category: Design & Product Research
Built by: Mobbin (github.com/mobbin/mobbin-mcp-server)
```

## Why This Matters for Operators

"Let's redesign the onboarding" used to mean a designer hand-collecting screenshots from ten competitors. **Mobbin's tools make that research a question**: "show me how fintech apps do first-run onboarding" returns real screens with their source links; "find checkout flows with one-page payment" returns multi-step flow previews. Because the tools return inline images, an agent with vision can actually analyze the screens - layout, copy, hierarchy - rather than guess from metadata.

## Tools & Capabilities

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `search_screens` | Natural-language search for UI screens; returns inline images + metadata + canonical mobbin_url |
| `search_flows` | Multi-step user flows (onboarding, checkout) with evenly-spaced preview images per screen |
| `search_sections` | Website sections (About, Pricing, Footer) with inline images |

Tool instructions enforce citation discipline: when presenting results, each screen must be linked to its `mobbin_url`, and descriptions must come from examining the images, not from metadata alone.

## Installation

```bash
claude mcp add mobbin --transport http https://api.mobbin.com/mcp
```

First connect opens a browser OAuth flow to sign in to your Mobbin account.

## Configuration

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mobbin": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://api.mobbin.com/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

## Business Relevance

- **Founders validating a feature** pull every competitor's take on the flow in one session
- **Designers** start projects from real, cited screens instead of memory
- **Product teams** brief engineers with actual UI references linked to their sources
- **Agencies pitching redesigns** ground proposals in what the category's best products actually ship

## Integration with CorpusIQ

Mobbin informs what to build; CorpusIQ measures whether it worked. A product session can research patterns in Mobbin (how do top SaaS apps price and onboard), implement, then validate through CorpusIQ - GA4 conversion funnels, Stripe checkout data, HubSpot win rates - so the design loop runs from reference to result in one agent workflow. For competitive product teardowns, Mobbin's screens pair with CorpusIQ's web-fetch and market connectors for evidence-backed comparisons.

## Limitations

- Design reference only - no code, no components, no analytics
- Requires a Mobbin account and plan for full corpus access; OAuth on connect
- Vision-capable clients get the most value; text-only clients see metadata without the images
- New MCP listing (Aug 2026) for a long-established vendor
- Three tools is a deliberately narrow surface - search is the whole product
