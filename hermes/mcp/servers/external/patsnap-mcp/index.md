### Claude Desktop / Codex
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "patsnap": {
      "type": "streamable-http",
      "url": "https://api.patsnap.com/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_PATSNAP_API_KEY"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## CorpusIQ Integration

Patsnap MCP pairs with CorpusIQ for operator workflows:

1. **Competitive Intel Pipeline:** Patsnap patent search → CorpusIQ company financials → comprehensive competitor profile
2. **M&A Due Diligence:** Patsnap IP portfolio analysis + CorpusIQ financial data + DataNexus MCP for vendor verification
3. **R&D Prioritization:** Patsnap technology landscape + CorpusIQ market data = data-driven R&D investment decisions

## Limitations

- Requires Patsnap subscription/account (enterprise pricing)
- New MCP server (July 22, 2026) - early-stage, API may evolve
- Patent data is inherently complex - agents may need guidance on search strategy
- Not all jurisdictions may have full-text searchable patents
