# EuroDNS MCP

**MCP server (stdio or streamable HTTP)** - the full EuroDNS User API (Luxembourg registrar) as 82 agent tools: domains, DNS zones, contacts, subscriptions, SSL certificates, invoices and orders. Independent open-source project, not affiliated with EuroDNS, with two independent authorization gates and an audit log fed by every call including refusals.

```
Server type: Self-hosted (npx @jigsawfr/eurodns-mcp) or shared HTTP deployment (container)
Auth: OAuth 2.1 or shared token on HTTP; EuroDNS Application ID + API key for the upstream API
Tools: 82 (79 OpenAPI-generated + 3 DNS workflow tools)
Guardrails: read-only / billing / destructive refusals with the setting named in the error
License: MIT · Node.js 22+
Repo: JigSawFr/eurodns-mcp
```

## Why This Matters for Operators

Registrar consoles are where domain portfolios live, and the operations are boring, risky and frequent: renewals, DNS record edits, SSL subscription checks, contact updates. This server makes them agent-operable with the safety rails a registrar API demands. **The three dedicated DNS workflow tools exist because editing a zone replaces it - the diff tool shows what would change before anything is written, and upsert edits a single record instead of the whole zone.**

The guardrail system is the differentiator: a deployment can refuse whole risk classes (read-only, billing, destructive) and the error names the exact setting to change, so an operator can ship a read-only deployment to a junior agent and a full one to an admin. Every call - including refusals - lands in a hash-chained audit log queryable via `eurodns_audit_query`, because the upstream API authenticates with one shared key and cannot attribute calls itself.

## Tools & Capabilities

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `eurodns_domain_check_availability` | Is a domain available in a TLD |
| `eurodns_domain_search` | Search the portfolio (e.g. which domains have DNSSEC enabled) |
| `eurodns_dns_get_zone` | Read a DNS zone |
| `eurodns_dns_upsert_record` | Add or update a single record without replacing the zone |
| `eurodns_dns_diff_zone` | Preview what would change before a zone edit |
| `eurodns_ssl_list_subscriptions` | SSL certificate subscriptions and expiry |
| `eurodns_account_get_prepaid_balance` | Prepaid account balance |
| `eurodns_audit_query` | What was done, by whom, and what was refused and why |

Plus the remaining OpenAPI-generated surface: contacts, subscriptions, invoices and orders. A deployment resource lists what the deployment allows and why a tool may be absent.

## Installation

```bash
npx -y @jigsawfr/eurodns-mcp
```

Set `EURODNS_APP_ID` and `EURODNS_API_KEY` (created in the EuroDNS dashboard). The public IP of the machine running the server must be allowlisted in the dashboard - a 403 from the API is almost always a missing allowlist entry, not bad credentials. For a shared HTTP deployment, use the container image; the package also ships `eurodns-mcp-http` for the HTTP transport.

## Configuration

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "eurodns": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@jigsawfr/eurodns-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "EURODNS_APP_ID": "your-application-id",
        "EURODNS_API_KEY": "your-api-key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Optional 1Password Connect integration can source any secret via `op://` references at startup. The HTTP transport adds OAuth 2.1 or a shared bearer token with scope gating on top of the deployment guardrails.

## Business Relevance

- **Domain portfolio managers** run renewals, DNS edits and SSL checks from an agent.
- **SRE and DevOps teams** get zone diffs and safe record upserts instead of full-zone replaces.
- **Finance operations** read prepaid balance and invoices through the same interface.
- **Compliance** gets a hash-chained audit log of every registrar action, including refusals.

## Integration with CorpusIQ

CorpusIQ covers the financial and business-data layer; EuroDNS MCP covers the domain infrastructure layer operators run beside it. A CorpusIQ agent auditing a company's tech footprint can check domain availability, DNSSEC coverage and SSL expiry through this server while CorpusIQ supplies the business context - a natural pairing for due-diligence and M&A workflows.

## Limitations

- Independent project (1 star); not supported by EuroDNS itself.
- Self-hosted: the operator runs and updates the server and manages the IP allowlist.
- Requires EuroDNS API credentials; no anonymous or read-only public mode.
- Node.js 22+ required; the container image runs Node 24 LTS.
