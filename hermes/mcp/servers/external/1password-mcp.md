# 1Password MCP Server ★ Official (Beta) - New July 17

The 1Password MCP server bridges MCP-compatible AI agents (Codex, Kiro, Claude Code, Cursor) to 1Password Environments - letting agents create environments, list variables, and manage secrets without ever reading or exposing the secret values.

This is the first major secrets-management platform to ship an official MCP server, marking a significant milestone in AI agent security infrastructure.

**Source:** mcpservers.org (discovered July 17, 2026)
**Category:** Security / DevOps / Secrets Management
**Author:** 1Password (Official)
**Docs:** https://www.1password.dev/environments/mcp-server
**Status:** Beta (released July 2026)

## Key Innovation: Agent-Managed Secrets Without Exposure

The core design principle is unlike any other MCP server: **the agent never sees the secrets.** The MCP server acts as a secure bridge that:

- **Creates Environments** - provision new 1Password Environments from an MCP client
- **Lists variable names** - enumerate environment variables without revealing values
- **Manages secrets** - update, rotate, and organize secrets through authorized processes
- **Authorizes via prompts** - every sensitive operation triggers a human authorization prompt

Secrets remain in 1Password and are only accessed by authorized processes at runtime. The MCP client (your AI agent) orchestrates secrets management while 1Password enforces the security boundary.

## Requirements

- A 1Password account with Environments access
- An MCP-compatible client (Codex, Kiro, Claude Code, Cursor, VS Code)
- 1Password CLI installed for local development workflows

## Setup

### Step 1: Enable MCP Server Access in 1Password

Navigate to your 1Password Environments settings and turn on MCP server access. This generates the connection endpoint your MCP client will use.

### Step 2: Configure Your MCP Client

Add the 1Password MCP server endpoint to your client's MCP configuration. For Claude Code:

```bash
claude mcp add 1password --url https://your-environment.1password.dev/mcp
```

For Cursor/VS Code, add to your `mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "1password": {
      "url": "https://your-environment.1password.dev/mcp",
      "transport": "streamable-http"
    }
  }
}
```

First connection triggers an OAuth authorization flow - sign in to 1Password and authorize the MCP client.

## Business Relevance

This is a landmark MCP server for operators running AI agents in production:

1. **Security-first agent operations:** For the first time, you can let AI agents manage infrastructure secrets without granting them read access to those secrets. This solves the fundamental tension between agent autonomy and security.

2. **Auditable agent actions:** Every secrets operation goes through 1Password's authorization prompts, creating an audit trail of what the agent attempted and what was approved.

3. **Enterprise-ready patterns:** 1Password's approach - agent orchestrates, platform enforces - sets the pattern for enterprise MCP integrations. Expect similar designs from AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault, and Azure Key Vault.

4. **Environment provisioning at scale:** Operators managing multiple deployment environments can let agents handle the mechanical work of creating and organizing environments while maintaining zero-trust on secret values.

## Use Cases for Business Operators

- **CI/CD pipeline setup:** Agent provisions environment variables for new deployment stages without human copying of secrets
- **Secret rotation automation:** Agent initiates rotation workflows, human approves, secrets update without agent exposure
- **Multi-environment management:** Agent organizes variables across dev/staging/production environments
- **Onboarding automation:** Agent creates environments for new team members or services

## Limitations (Beta)

- Currently supports Codex and Kiro as primary MCP clients; broader client support expected
- Beta status - API may change before GA
- Requires 1Password Environments (separate from standard 1Password vaults)
