# Subtext MCP

**Agent-native session replay** from Fullstory. Captures production sessions of your application and connects them to your coding agent - Claude Code, Cursor, Codex - so it can debug issues, analyze user behavior, and improve UX from real session data.

## Why It Matters for Operators

For operators running SaaS products or web applications, Subtext MCP bridges the gap between production issues and AI-driven debugging:

- **Agent-Driven Debugging:** Your AI agent replays the exact user session where a bug occurred
- **UX Analysis:** AI reviews real user sessions to identify friction points
- **Support Triage:** Connect support tickets to session replays for faster resolution
- **No Context Switching:** Debug production issues without leaving your coding agent

## Setup

### Claude Code / Codex
```bash
claude mcp add subtext --url https://api.subtext.fullstory.com/mcp --header "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

## CorpusIQ Integration

Subtext helps operators who use CorpusIQ alongside customer-facing applications:

1. **Bug → Fix Pipeline:** Customer reports issue → Subtext replays session → Agent diagnoses → fix deployed
2. **Conversion Analysis:** Subtext session replays + CorpusIQ Stripe data = full purchase funnel visibility
3. **Support Efficiency:** Reduce time-to-resolution by giving agents direct access to session context

## Limitations

- Requires Fullstory/Subtext subscription
- 9 stars - early adoption, API may evolve
- Only useful for operators with web applications (not API-only products)
- Session data can be large - consider sampling for agent analysis
