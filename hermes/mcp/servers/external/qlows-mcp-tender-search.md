# qlows MCP - Tender & RFP Search

## What It Is

qlows MCP (`getqlows/qlows-mcp`) provides real-time tender and RFP search across the WTO-GPA zone - 35 countries including the US, EU member states, and Australia. Business development teams and proposal writers can search live procurement opportunities, analyze requirements, and draft RFP responses with AI grounded in actual tender documents.

## Tools Available

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Tender search | Search by keyword, category, country, value, deadline |
| Requirement extraction | Parse RFP documents for key requirements and evaluation criteria |
| Opportunity matching | Match company capabilities to relevant tenders |

## Quick Start

```bash
npx mcp-remote https://app.qlows.com/api/mcp/{MINT_TOKEN}/rpc
```

## Business Use Cases

1. **Opportunity pipeline**: "Show me all open IT services tenders in Germany and France with budgets over €500K closing this month"
2. **RFP analysis**: "Extract the technical requirements, evaluation criteria, and submission deadline from this 80-page RFP"
3. **Competitive intelligence**: "Which companies have won similar tenders in the past 12 months?"
4. **Proposal drafting**: "Draft the technical approach section for Tender #4521 based on our standard capabilities and the RFP requirements"

## Limitations

- **WTO-GPA zone only**: 35 countries - no coverage for China, India, Brazil, or most developing markets
- **Token-gated**: Requires a qlows MINT token for API access
- **Remote-hosted**: Depends on qlows.com uptime
