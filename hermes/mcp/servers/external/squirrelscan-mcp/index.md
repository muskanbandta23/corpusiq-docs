# squirrelscan - SEO & Performance Audit MCP for AI Agents

**Website auditing through MCP.** squirrelscan audits websites across SEO, performance, security, accessibility, and "agent experience" - then provides exact fixes your coding agent can implement immediately.

## What It Does for Operators

- **SEO audit** - Meta tags, structured data, content gaps, indexing issues
- **Performance audit** - Core Web Vitals, load times, resource optimization
- **Security audit** - HTTPS, headers, dependency vulnerabilities
- **Accessibility audit** - WCAG compliance, screen reader compatibility
- **Agent Experience audit** - Novel: audits whether your site is agent-friendly (structured data, API discoverability)
- **Actionable fixes** - Not just problems - exact code changes your AI coding agent can apply

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/squirrelscan/squirrelscan.git
cd squirrelscan
# Follow repo instructions for setup
```

## Claude Desktop / Hermes Config

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "squirrelscan": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["path/to/squirrelscan/server.js"]
    }

```

## Key Tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|

*Note: Tool names are approximate. See github.com/squirrelscan/squirrelscan.*

## Operator Use Cases

1. **SaaS Operators** - Weekly automated audit of your landing page + docs site
2. **Agencies** - Audit client sites before delivery. Generate fix tickets for your dev team.
3. **Ecommerce** - Monitor SEO health across product pages and category templates
4. **AI-Native Companies** - The "agent experience" audit ensures your site is discoverable by AI agents

## CorpusIQ Angle

squirrelscan's "agent experience" audit is forward-looking. As AI agents become a significant traffic source, websites need to be machine-readable. Operators using CorpusIQ for business intelligence can use squirrelscan to ensure their public-facing properties are optimized for both human visitors AND AI agents.

## Limitations

- Early-stage project - audit thoroughness TBD
- Requires coding agent to apply fixes (not one-click)
- "Agent experience" audit category is experimental
- May overlap with established tools like Lighthouse, Ahrefs
