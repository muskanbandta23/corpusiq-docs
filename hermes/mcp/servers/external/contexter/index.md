# Contexter MCP

**A hosted MCP server that gives a project one shared context across ChatGPT, Claude, Telegram, and any MCP client - save what matters in one assistant, continue it in another, and share it with people who use their own AI.** Today that means re-explaining the project at every hop, and the person you work with cannot pick it up at all. Contexter replaces the per-tool copies with one context: assistants read and write the same records, and humans join through their own assistants or a Telegram bot. 26 tools, OAuth 2.1 with dynamic client registration, free during early access.

```
Server type: Remote (Streamable HTTP), hosted
Auth: OAuth 2.1 with dynamic client registration (sign in through Telegram)
Endpoint: https://contexterai.com/mcp
Scopes: contexts:read, messages:read, artifacts:write
Tools: 26 (8 reading, 7 saving, 5 sharing, 6 removing)
Pricing: Free during early access
Category: Productivity / Collaboration
Built by: maaakso; repo github.com/maaakso/contexter-mcp (docs), registry io.github.maaakso/contexter
```

## Why This Matters for Operators

Operators run the same project through several assistants - planning in ChatGPT, drafting in Claude Code, discussing in a Telegram group - and every hop re-explains the project. The collaborator who uses their own AI cannot pick up the thread at all. Contexter gives the project one context instead of a copy per tool: save an assistant's result as an artifact, open it in a different assistant, and share the context with a teammate who reads it through their own assistant.

The sharing rail is designed around consent and proof. Share steps show how many records and whose a new member would read before an invitation is issued; invitations arrive as Telegram cards where you pick the recipient with the chat picker, so no link is ever printed into a chat. Deliver-to-chat never sends by itself - a confirmation card shows the chat, the text, and the readership count, and the message leaves only when you press it.

**Project context becomes one shared, permissioned surface across assistants and people.**

## Tools & Capabilities

| Group | Tools |
|---|---|
| Reading (8) | list_contexts, get_context_card, get_context_feed, list_records, list_sources, get_artifact, get_file, read_image_content |
| Saving (7) | save_artifact, save_file, create_context, add_records_to_context, update_artifact, update_context, set_context_notifications |
| Sharing (5) | share_context, revoke_context_access, check_share_audience, deliver_to_chat, invite_room_to_context |
| Removing (6) | remove_record_from_context, delete_record, leave_context, restore_record, delete_context, restore_context |

## Installation

Nothing to install. Add the endpoint as a custom connector in any client that speaks Streamable HTTP, then sign in through Telegram when the OAuth flow opens.

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http contexter https://contexterai.com/mcp
```

Per-client step-by-step guides are on the help page at contexterai.com.

## Configuration

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "contexter": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://contexterai.com/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

The endpoint publishes discovery, dynamic client registration, and OAuth 2.1 metadata from the same origin, so the URL alone is enough - no API key. The token carries the scopes of whoever completed the Telegram sign-in, and anything that widens an audience waits for a human yes.

## Business Relevance

- **Founders and project leads** keep one living context for a project instead of re-explaining it in every assistant.
- **Teams using different assistants** share context with people who use their own AI, with per-person visibility.
- **Telegram-group operators** deliver assistant results into group chats with a confirmation card and readership count.
- **Client-facing operators** share a context with a counterparty and revoke access cleanly when the engagement ends.

## Integration with CorpusIQ

Contexter pairs with CorpusIQ's Telegram-centric operations: CorpusIQ runs its team coordination through Telegram topics, and Contexter's deliver_to_chat and invite_room_to_context tools let a CorpusIQ-driven assistant publish results into a group with the same confirmation-gate discipline CorpusIQ applies to outbound content. For multi-agent work, a CorpusIQ workflow can save research artifacts to a client context (save_artifact, save_file), share the context with the operator's own assistant (share_context with check_share_audience first), and keep the audit trail in Contexter's feed instead of email chains. The read tools give CorpusIQ's reporting loop a single queryable surface for everything saved across assistants.

## Limitations

- Early access - free now, pricing unannounced, and the product can change shape.
- Repo is docs-only (no server source); you trust the hosted endpoint.
- Tools are scoped to one person's contexts; the value compounds with adoption, not solo use.
- Telegram is the sign-in rail - no email sign-in today.
