# MCP Server Scan - July 17, 2026 (Evening Supplement)

## Key Finding: Trello MCP Joins Atlassian's MCP Suite

Atlassian continues to expand its official MCP server lineup. After shipping the Jira/Confluence MCP server, they've now released an official Trello MCP server - a cloud-hosted bridge that gives AI tools secure, real-time access to Trello boards, lists, cards, and checklists.

**Significance:**

1. **Atlassian MCP strategy becomes clear:** Atlassian is now shipping official MCP servers for Jira, Confluence, AND Trello - covering the entire project management spectrum from engineering (Jira) to documentation (Confluence) to lightweight task management (Trello).

2. **Operator relevance:** Trello is widely used by business operators, marketing teams, and non-engineering departments. An official Trello MCP makes AI agents useful for the exact audience CorpusIQ targets.

3. **Security model:** OAuth 2.0, workspace-scoped access, no destructive delete operations (archive only). This is enterprise-ready from day one.

4. **Multi-platform:** Supports Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor, VS Code, and Gemini CLI out of the box.

## Key Finding: Nexly Analytics Fills the Analytics MCP Gap

Nexly provides product and web analytics via MCP - a category that's been underserved by official MCP servers. While Google Analytics has community MCP servers, Nexly offers a hosted, OAuth-secured, read-only analytics endpoint designed for AI agents.

**Use cases for operators:**
- Ask AI assistants about traffic trends without logging into dashboards
- Pull funnel conversion data into planning conversations
- Monitor anomalies and AI-traffic insights automatically

## Actions Taken

- ✅ 1 integration guide created for Trello MCP (Official Atlassian, major)
- ✅ 1 integration guide created for Nexly Analytics MCP (analytics, operator-relevant)
- ✅ 6 servers noted as INDEX-ONLY (niche or specialized)
- ✅ Evening supplement scan report created
- ✅ Cross-referenced against morning July 17 scan - all 8 are net-new
