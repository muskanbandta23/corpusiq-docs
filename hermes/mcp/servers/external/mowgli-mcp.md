# Mowgli MCP - Integration Guide

**What it does:** Mowgli is an intelligent product canvas that connects to coding agents via MCP. It lets product teams and developers iterate on product design - from sweeping new flows down to surgical component tweaks - and sync changes back to code, all through natural language conversations.

**Why it matters:** The design→development handoff is one of the highest-friction points in product development. Mowgli MCP eliminates "design drift" by making the product canvas directly accessible to AI coding agents, enabling faithful design-to-code translation and real-time design iteration without Figma exports, screenshots, or manual specification.

## Quick Info

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Transport** | Streamable HTTP (remote) |
| **Authentication** | API key / OAuth |
| **Endpoint** | `https://app.mowgli.ai/mcp` |
| **Source** | `app.mowgli.ai` |
| **Category** | Product Design & UX |
| **CorpusIQ Verdict** | ★★★★☆ - Game-changing for product teams, early-stage |

## Setup

### Prerequisites

1. Mowgli account (free tier available)
2. Mowgli project with an active canvas
3. API key from Mowgli dashboard → Settings → API

### 1. Get API Key

```bash
# In Mowgli dashboard:
# Settings → API → Generate Key
# Copy the key - it's shown once
```

### 2. Configure MCP Client

Add to your `claude_desktop_config.json` or equivalent:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mowgli": {
      "type": "sse",
      "url": "https://app.mowgli.ai/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer <your-api-key>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

For Claude Code or terminal-based clients:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mowgli": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@mowgli/mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "MOWGLI_API_KEY": "<your-api-key>",
        "MOWGLI_PROJECT_ID": "<your-project-id>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Available Tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `get_canvas` | Retrieve the current product canvas - screens, flows, components |
| `get_screen` | Get a specific screen's design, components, and states |
| `get_component` | Get detailed specs for a specific component (colors, spacing, variants) |
| `update_component` | Modify a component's properties (text, color, layout, state) |
| `create_screen` | Create a new screen with specified components and layout |
| `add_component` | Add a new component to an existing screen |
| `get_design_tokens` | Retrieve the project's design tokens (colors, typography, spacing) |
| `suggest_improvements` | AI-powered suggestions for UX improvements on a screen |
| `export_for_code` | Export screen/component as structured data for code generation |
| `sync_from_code` | Update canvas to reflect code changes (keep design in sync) |

## Operator Workflows

### Design Review → Code

```
Agent: "Review the onboarding flow in canvas and suggest improvements."
→ get_canvas(flow: "onboarding")
→ suggest_improvements(screen: "onboarding-step-2")
Agent: "Apply the suggestion to add a progress indicator and update the CTA text."
→ update_component(screen: "onboarding-step-2", component: "cta-button", text: "Continue to Step 3")
→ add_component(screen: "onboarding-step-2", type: "progress-bar", position: "top")
Agent: "Now generate the React code for this updated screen."
→ export_for_code(screen: "onboarding-step-2", framework: "react")
```

### Rapid Prototyping

```
Agent: "Create a settings page with profile, notifications, and billing sections."
→ create_screen(name: "Settings", sections: ["profile", "notifications", "billing"])
Agent: "Add email notification toggles: marketing, product updates, security alerts."
→ add_component(screen: "Settings", section: "notifications", type: "toggle-group", items: ["marketing", "product-updates", "security-alerts"])
Agent: "Use the project's design tokens for consistent styling."
→ get_design_tokens()
→ [Applies tokens to new components]
```

### Design Drift Detection

```
Agent: "Compare the current checkout screen in code against the Mowgli canvas."
→ get_canvas(flow: "checkout")
→ [Agent compares against codebase]
Agent: "Found 3 discrepancies: button color, spacing in form, missing loading state. Update code to match canvas."
→ export_for_code(screen: "checkout", format: "diff")
```

## Limitations

- **Early-stage product:** Mowgli is newer than established tools like Figma
- **Canvas complexity:** Very large canvases (50+ screens) may hit token limits
- **No Figma import:** Cannot yet import existing Figma files (on roadmap)
- **Component library:** Growing but smaller than Figma community libraries
- **Real-time collaboration:** Single-user editing via MCP; multi-user coming

## Alternatives

| Server | Best For |
|--------|----------|
| **Figma MCP** | Established design teams with existing Figma files |
| **Design Context Bridge** | Direct Figma-to-code (reads Figma files without Mowgli canvas) |
| **Penpot MCP** | Open-source design tool alternative |
| **Builder.io MCP** | Visual CMS + design-to-code for marketing sites |

## CorpusIQ Assessment

**Strategic Value:** High. The product canvas approach - where design lives as structured data that both humans and AI can manipulate - is the future of design-to-code workflows. Mowgli's MCP integration makes this vision tangible today.

**Integration Difficulty:** Low. Remote endpoint with API key auth. No local dependencies.

**Risk:** Medium. Early-stage product means potential API changes and growing pains. The core concept is sound.

**Recommendation:** **Catalog and recommend** for product teams who want AI-assisted design iteration. Pairs exceptionally well with coding agents (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex) for design-to-code workflows. Watch for Figma import support (on roadmap) which would dramatically expand utility.
