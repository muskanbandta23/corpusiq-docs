## GitHub API Results

GitHub search for `topic:mcp-server pushed:>2026-07-02` returned 0 new results - no new MCP servers pushed to GitHub since the July 2 evening scan. The July 2 scans captured the pipeworx-io batch (18+ servers) and other discoveries comprehensively.

## Trends

- **Scheduling goes MCP-native**: Cal.com MCP represents the first major scheduling platform to release an official MCP server. Expect Calendly, SavvyCal, and others to follow.
- **Meeting notes become queryable**: Granola MCP transforms meeting notes from passive records to active knowledge bases accessible by AI agents. This is the "second brain" pattern - institutional knowledge that agents can query.
- **Finance vertical deepens**: With Co-Invest MCP, Alpha Vantage MCP, plus existing SentiSense, Kalshi, and HPSILab Quant, operators now have a complete AI-driven investment stack - research, analysis, sentiment, execution, and prediction markets.
- **Amazon sellers get AI-native tools**: Webotee Amazon MCP signals that ecommerce intelligence tools are adopting MCP as a distribution channel. This is a major underserved market - 2M+ Amazon sellers need better research tools.
- **Social media management goes agentic**: OpenTweet MCP represents a shift from dashboard-based social media management to agentic workflows. The "compose thread, schedule, monitor engagement" loop moves entirely into AI conversations.
- **Infrastructure & auth MCPs emerge**: getmcpauth and CloudMesh AI represent the "picks and shovels" layer - infrastructure that makes MCP servers easier to build and deploy securely.

## Actions Taken

- 6 full integration guides created for priority servers (see individual `.md` files in this directory):
  - `calcom-mcp.md`
  - `granola-mcp.md`
  - `coinvest-mcp.md`
  - `alphavantage-mcp.md`
  - `webotee-amazon-mcp.md`
  - `opentweet-mcp.md`
- 4 additional servers noted (indexed, no individual guide - too niche or infrastructure-layer)
- Index.md updated with new server entries
