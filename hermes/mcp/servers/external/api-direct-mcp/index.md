## Why This Matters for Operators

Public social and local-business data has always been valuable and always been painful to collect. Thirteen different platforms, thirteen different auth walls, rate limits, and scrapers that break whenever a site changes markup. The result is that lead-gen, competitive monitoring, and reputation work gets done manually, occasionally, or by tools that only cover one platform.

**API Direct collapses all thirteen into one API key and one MCP endpoint.** The agent asks for LinkedIn posts by founders at Series-A companies, X replies to a competitor's launch tweet, Google Maps reviews of a local acquisition target, or news coverage of a crisis - and gets back structured JSON with engagement metrics, sentiment options, and citations, all billed per request.

The differentiator is the skills layer. `list_skills` returns 60+ playbooks - expert recipes with the non-obvious filters already encoded (author title, company mentions, AI sentiment, freshness windows). `get_skill` returns a step-by-step recipe with the caller's inputs filled in. The agent stops improvising raw searches and starts running "competitor conquest," "churn intent," or "outage early warning" as a single outcome-shaped call.

## Installation

```bash
claude mcp add api-direct --transport http "https://apidirect.io/mcp?token=YOUR_API_KEY"
```

Per-client walkthroughs are published on the mcp.so listing page; the endpoint is the same for every client. Sign up at apidirect.io to get an API key.

## Configuration

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "api-direct": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://apidirect.io/mcp?token=YOUR_API_KEY"
    }
  }
}
```

The key can alternatively be sent as an `X-API-Key` or `Authorization` header. Pay-as-you-go credit meter - no subscription required.

## Business Relevance

- **Founders and sales leads** get competitor-conquest lists, just-funded outreach windows, and local buying-intent capture without paying for a seat in a social-listening suite
- **Recruiters and hiring managers** source talent by title and company, intercept layoff waves, and verify candidate signal from public posts
- **Investors and deal sourcers** run due-diligence dossiers, adverse-media sweeps, and cross-platform identity resolution from one tool call
- **Marketing operators** monitor brand mentions, share of voice, and detractor radar across thirteen platforms, with AI sentiment on every result
- **Local-service operators** pull Google Maps ratings, reviews, and owner contact data for acquisition lists and reputation audits

## Integration with CorpusIQ

API Direct feeds the top of the funnel; CorpusIQ closes and measures it. A composed workflow: `get_skill` (local-buying-intent-capture) surfaces prospects talking about a pain point, `search_linkedin` and `search_twitter` resolve who they are and who they work for, then CorpusIQ's HubSpot connector records them as contacts with the social context attached, Klaviyo runs the nurture sequence, and GA4 + Stripe measure whether the social-sourced cohort actually converts. Every lead keeps its provenance - which post, which platform, which playbook - so attribution survives from first signal to first invoice.

For competitive intelligence, API Direct's market-map and pricing-objection playbooks complement CorpusIQ's Ahrefs and Semrush connectors: the SEO connectors show what a competitor ranks for, API Direct shows what their customers complain about in public.

## Limitations

- Brand new listing (Aug 2026) - no long track record yet
- Pay-as-you-go pricing means unbounded agents can burn credits; set spend caps before wiring it into autonomous workflows
- Data is public-only - no authenticated/private feeds, no DMs, no posting (read-only by design)
- Platform availability can shift as underlying sites change; individual endpoint coverage varies
- Live tool list is served from the endpoint - the 68-tool count and table above come from the published listing, verify after connecting
