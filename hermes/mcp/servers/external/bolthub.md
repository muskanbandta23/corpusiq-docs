# Bolthub MCP - L402 Paid-API Marketplace

Bolthub is an API marketplace where AI agents discover and pay for tools on a per-call basis using Bitcoin Lightning payments via the L402 protocol. No credit cards, no subscriptions, no human in the loop - agents autonomously purchase API access with micropayments.

## Why This Matters

The agent economy needs a payment rail. Current API billing is built for humans - monthly subscriptions, credit cards, usage tiers decided in dashboards. L402 enables agents to make autonomous micro-purchases: "I need this data once, I'll pay $0.002 for it." Bolthub aggregates L402-enabled APIs into a discoverable marketplace, letting agents shop for tools the way humans browse app stores.

## Installation

```bash
# Remote MCP - connect directly
# Or run locally:
npm install -g bolthub-mcp
npx bolthub-mcp
```

## Claude Desktop / Hermes Configuration

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "bolthub": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["bolthub-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "L402_WALLET_PATH": "~/.l402/wallet"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Key Tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `search_apis` | Discover L402-enabled APIs by category and price |
| `purchase_access` | Buy single-call access to an API via Lightning |
| `check_balance` | View available Lightning wallet balance |
| `list_purchases` | Review past API purchases and their outcomes |

## L402 Protocol

L402 is the Lightning Network's HTTP 402 Payment Required standard. It enables:
- **Per-call micropayments** - pay $0.001-$0.01 per API call
- **No accounts** - cryptographic auth via Lightning wallet keys
- **Instant settlement** - payments clear in seconds on Lightning

## CorpusIQ Relevance

As CorpusIQ scales its MCP server to more operators, L402-based billing could be an alternative to traditional subscription pricing - especially for operators who only need occasional API access. Bolthub demonstrates the marketplace model: CorpusIQ's MCP server could be listed as an L402-enabled API, allowing agents to purchase business data queries on-demand.
