# System Registry

In autonomous systems, uncontrolled creation leads to chaos. The System Registry validates every component before creation  --  skills, workflows, automations, cron jobs  --  ensuring nothing is duplicated and everything has an owner.

## Registry Checks

Before creating any new component, the registry validates:

1. **Does it already exist?**  --  Search by name, function, and capability overlap
2. **Who owns it?**  --  Each component has an assigned maintainer
3. **Is it active?**  --  Components marked deprecated if unused for 30+ days
4. **Dependencies?**  --  What other components rely on it

## Registry Contents

| Component Type | Count | Example |
|---------------|-------|---------|
| Skills | 73+ | growth, content, research |
| Cron Jobs | 24 | email-monitor, social-posting |
| MCP Connectors | 30+ | ga4, stripe, shopify |
| Agents | 5+ | growth, content, governance |

## Prevention Patterns

The registry prevents creation of duplicate skills (e.g., two "email monitor" implementations), overlapping cron schedules, conflicting automation rules, and orphaned components.

## Self-Audit

Weekly registry audits identify stale components, missing owners, and dependency loops. Results reported to governance agent for cleanup.

## Email Operations

The platform autonomously monitors two inboxes (`team@` and `info@`) handling lead qualification, internal routing, research, draft generation, and escalation.

## Inbox Architecture

| Inbox | Purpose | Agent |
|-------|---------|-------|
| team@example.com | Business operations, growth, partnerships | Growth Agent |
| info@example.com | Inquiries, support routing | General Agent |

## Monitoring Pipeline

```
Inbound → Classification → Routing → Draft/Respond → Escalate (if needed)
```

### Classification
Emails classified by: lead quality (business domain scoring), urgency, required expertise, and response SLA.

### Routing
- **Sales/partnership** → Growth Agent with research context
- **Technical/support** → Dev team
- **Job applications** → personal inbox (forwarded)
- **Unknown** → Manual review queue

## Email Standards

All outbound emails pass through validation: no AI buzzwords, no emdashes, professional HTML format, verified phone numbers, and signature consistency.

## Monitoring Reliability

Email crons run every 15 minutes with delivery verification. Failed checks trigger immediate re-runs. A separate forward-handler ensures job application replies reach the correct inbox.

## Autonomous Scheduling

The platform operates 24 scheduled processes executing on a 24/7 basis: email monitoring, social publishing, video generation, knowledge consolidation, reporting, and self-improvement cycles.

## Schedule Categories

| Category | Count | Examples |
|----------|-------|----------|
| Email Operations | 3 | Monitor, forward, respond |
| Social Publishing | 5 | Posts, comments, video |
| Knowledge | 3 | GBrain dream, GitHub monitors |
| Monitoring | 4 | Health, MCP directory, release |
| Growth | 3 | Tech research, help-first, HN |
| Self-Improvement | 2 | Daily cycle, system audit |

## Cron Architecture

Crons run on the primary compute node. A dedicated worker handles browser-dependent tasks via remote SSH. Each cron is verified  --  status checks catch failures and escalate.

## Scheduling Principles

- **Staggered execution**  --  jobs spaced to avoid resource contention
- **Retry logic**  --  failed jobs retry with exponential backoff
- **Silent success**  --  jobs report only on breakpoints, not routine success
- **Manual override**  --  critical jobs have pause/resume controls

## Verification

Crons are never trusted at face value. The `corpusiq-cron-delivery-audit` process runs all crons once to verify they actually deliver, checking actual output against expected output.

## Operational Monitoring

A 10 PM daily system health check runs across all 24 crons, verifying execution status, output quality, and system resources.

## Health Check Coverage

1. **Cron health**  --  All 24 jobs verified for last successful run
2. **Disk space**  --  DGX and Mac Mini storage alerts at 80%
3. **Token validity**  --  All OAuth tokens verified non-expired
4. **Model availability**  --  Ollama, DeepSeek, Claude endpoints tested
5. **Email delivery**  --  Outbound relay verified
6. **GitHub access**  --  Token and push capability tested

## Anomaly Detection

The system monitors for unusual patterns: cron failure rate spikes, model latency degradation, email delivery failures, and token expiry approaches.

## Escalation

Issues classified by severity. P1 (authentication failure, database corruption) triggers immediate alert. P2 (cron failure, slow model) triggers next-cycle remediation. P3 (cosmetic, non-blocking) logged for weekly review.

## Self-Healing

The self-improvement cron at 11 PM analyzes the day's issues and patches skills, updates documentation, and adjusts cron timing to prevent recurrence.
