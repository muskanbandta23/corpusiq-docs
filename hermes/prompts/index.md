## What's Inside

| Collection | File | Use For |
|---|---|---|
| Code Generation | `code-generation.md` | Writing, refactoring, debugging, and reviewing code |
| Content Creation | `content-creation.md` | Blog posts, social media, email, video scripts, SEO |
| Data Analysis | `data-analysis.md` | SQL queries, reporting, visualization, metrics |
| Business Operations | `business-operations.md` | Email, meetings, project planning, task management |
| Research | `research.md` | Competitive analysis, market sizing, tech evaluation |
| Creative | `creative.md` | Brainstorming, naming, design briefs, creative strategy |

## How to Customize Prompts

### The Bracket Convention

Every prompt uses `[BRACKETED TEXT]` as a placeholder. Replace these with your specific details before sending the prompt to any model. For example:

**Template:** "Write a [WORD COUNT]-word blog post about [TOPIC] targeting [AUDIENCE]."

**Filled:** "Write a 1200-word blog post about Kubernetes cost optimization targeting DevOps engineers at Series B startups."

The more specific your replacements, the better your output. Vague inputs produce generic results.

### Adding Your Context

Most prompts work better when you add:

1. **Examples of your style.** For emails, paste 2-3 emails you've written that you like. For code, include a function from your codebase that shows your patterns.
2. **Your data schema.** For analysis prompts, include actual table names and column types.
3. **Your constraints.** Mention specific frameworks, brand guidelines, budget limits, or technical requirements.
4. **Your definition of success.** What does "good" look like for this specific output?

### Combining Prompts

These prompts are designed to be chained. Common pipelines include:

- **Code pipeline:** code generation → code review → test generation → documentation
- **Content pipeline:** research prompt → outline → first draft → editing pass
- **Analysis pipeline:** exploratory analysis → anomaly detection → report generation
- **Operations pipeline:** task breakdown → sprint plan → daily standup → weekly recap

## Model Selection Guide

Not all prompts work equally well with all models. Here's a general guide:

### Code Generation and Debugging
**Best with:** Claude 3.5 Sonnet, GPT-4o, DeepSeek V3, Gemini 2.5 Pro
**Why:** These models excel at structured reasoning, syntax accuracy, and following detailed technical specifications. For simple boilerplate, smaller local models like CodeLlama or DeepSeek Coder can handle it efficiently.

### Content Creation
**Best with:** Claude 3.5 Sonnet, GPT-4o
**Why:** Strong prose generation, tone control, and brand voice consistency. For high-volume social content, smaller models fine-tuned on your brand voice can be more cost-effective.

### Data Analysis
**Best with:** Claude 3.5 Sonnet (long context for schemas), GPT-4o
**Why:** SQL generation accuracy, ability to reason about complex schemas, and thorough edge-case handling. Provide actual schema definitions  --  don't summarize them.

### Business Operations
**Best with:** Claude 3.5 Sonnet, GPT-4o, Gemini Flash
**Why:** Email and meeting tasks benefit from nuanced understanding of professional context and relationship dynamics. For quick drafts, smaller/faster models work well; for sensitive communications, use a frontier model.

### Research
**Best with:** Claude 3.5 Sonnet (200K context for document analysis), GPT-4o with web search
**Why:** Research tasks often involve synthesizing large amounts of information. Long-context models handle document dumps better. Web-enabled models can pull in current data.

### Creative Work
**Best with:** Claude 3.5 Sonnet, GPT-4, Gemini
**Why:** Creative tasks benefit from models that take interesting "risks" in their outputs. Temperature settings matter  --  try 0.8-1.0 for brainstorming, 0.5-0.7 for refined creative output.

## Prompt Chaining Strategies

### Sequential Refinement
Start with a broad prompt, evaluate the output, then follow up with targeted refinements:
1. "Write a blog post about [TOPIC]." → gets a first draft
2. "Make the introduction more personal, add a customer story." → improves specific sections
3. "Shorten everything by 20% and add subheadings." → tightens and structures

### Parallel Generation
For creative tasks, run the same prompt 3-5 times (or ask for 3-5 variants in one prompt) and select the best. Models are non-deterministic  --  different runs produce different ideas.

### Role-Based Chaining
Use different system prompts for different stages:
1. **Researcher** persona: gather facts and outline structure
2. **Writer** persona: draft the content
3. **Editor** persona: review, tighten, improve flow
4. **Fact-checker** persona: verify claims and data

## Common Pitfalls and Fixes

| Problem | Likely Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Output is too generic | Placeholders too vague | Add specific constraints, examples, audience details |
| Model ignores a key requirement | Buried in long prompt | Put critical requirements at the top or repeat them |
| Code doesn't run | Missing context about environment | Specify language version, framework, dependencies |
| Creative output is bland | Temperature too low | Use temperature 0.8-1.0; ask for "surprising" or "unconventional" ideas |
| Analysis is shallow | Didn't provide schema or data sample | Give the actual structure, not a description of it |
| Email feels robotic | No style examples given | Paste 2-3 examples of your own writing as reference |
