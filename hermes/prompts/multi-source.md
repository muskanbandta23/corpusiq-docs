# Multi-source prompts  --  the moat

These prompts fire across **three or more connectors at once**. They're what
no single SaaS tool can give you, and they're the reason CorpusIQ exists.
The skills engine handles the orchestration  --  you just ask the question.

### "What's my true CAC and ROAS by channel?"

**Connectors used:** Google Ads, Meta Ads, TikTok, GA4, Shopify, QuickBooks.
**Behind the scenes:** `ad-spend-truth-report` skill.
**What this does:** The only attribution view that matters  --  joins every
ad platform's spend to actual revenue from Shopify/QuickBooks via GA4
sessions. Cuts through each platform's self-reported ROAS, which is
always optimistic.
**Sample answer shape:** Per-channel matrix: spend, attributed revenue,
conversions, CAC, ROAS, payback days, and a verdict.
