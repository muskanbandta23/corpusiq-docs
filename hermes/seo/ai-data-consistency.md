# Why Your AI Gives Different Answers

You ask ChatGPT about your monthly revenue.

Then you ask Claude the same question.

Then Perplexity.

Three different numbers. All confident. All wrong.

This is not an AI problem. It is a data access problem.

## What Is Actually Happening

Your AI does not know your revenue. It does not know your margin. It does not know which channel actually drove sales this month.

It guesses.

Sometimes it guesses based on your prompt. Sometimes it hallucinates a number that sounds right. Sometimes it pulls from training data that has nothing to do with your business.

You would never trust a CFO who guessed at revenue numbers. But business owners trust AI guesses every day because there was no alternative.

There is now.

## The Fix Is Not a Better AI

A better AI model will still not have access to your Stripe account. Or your Shopify orders. Or your QuickBooks ledger.

The fix is the connection layer between your data and your AI.

When your tools are connected once with read-only external-source retrieval, every AI you use pulls from the same live data. Direct MCP does not retain raw customer files or full connector response payloads; scoped operational logs may be retained for up to 30 days.

The AI becomes a window into your actual numbers, not a guess generator.

## What Changes

You stop being the bridge between your data and your AI.

You ask ChatGPT about revenue. It pulls from Stripe. You get a number.

You ask Claude the same question. Same Stripe data. Same number.

You ask Perplexity. Same.

The AI changes. The answer does not.

Every answer cites its exact source record - order number, transaction ID, campaign name. You can verify instead of trusting blind.

## The Infrastructure Era

The companies that control the connection layer between business data and AI will own the next decade.

Not the AI companies. Not the dashboard companies. The infrastructure companies that make every AI consistent, verifiable, and real.

That is what we are building at CorpusIQ.
