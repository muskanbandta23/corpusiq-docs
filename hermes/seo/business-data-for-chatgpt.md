# Business Data for ChatGPT: Stop Guessing, Start Knowing

ChatGPT can write code, draft emails, summarize documents, and brainstorm strategy. But ask it about your actual business numbers and it hits a wall you cannot see.

The wall is not intelligence. ChatGPT is smart enough to calculate margins, forecast cash flow, and analyze trends. The wall is access. It cannot reach your data.

Here is how to give ChatGPT real access to your business data.

## What ChatGPT Knows vs. What It Can Reach

ChatGPT knows a lot about business in general. It can tell you average ecommerce conversion rates, typical SaaS churn benchmarks, and common marketing ROAS figures. This is training data. It is statistical knowledge, not specific knowledge.

It does not know your QuickBooks balance. It cannot see your Shopify orders. It has no access to your Stripe payments or your GA4 traffic or your HubSpot pipeline. Every question about your actual business gets answered with general knowledge, not your actual numbers.

## The Types of Questions You Cannot Answer Today

**Financial**: What was our actual revenue last month? What is our current cash runway? Which clients are most profitable?

**Marketing**: What is our real blended ROAS? Which campaigns drove actual sales, not just clicks?

**Sales**: Which deals in our pipeline are most likely to close? What is our actual win rate by rep?

**Operations**: How many orders shipped yesterday? What is our current inventory position?

ChatGPT can answer general versions of these questions. It cannot answer them for your business. The difference is your data.

## How to Connect Your Business Data

The approach is not to move your data into ChatGPT. ChatGPT is not a database and should not become one. The approach is to create a read-only bridge between ChatGPT and your business tools.

Each tool connects independently:
- Shopify via read-only external-source retrieval for order and product data
- QuickBooks via Intuit API for financial data
- Stripe via restricted API key for payment data
- GA4 via Google Analytics API for traffic data
- HubSpot via OAuth for CRM data

When you ask a question, ChatGPT queries the relevant tools in real time. Direct MCP does not retain raw customer files or full connector response payloads; scoped operational logs may be retained for up to 30 days. Data handling inside ChatGPT follows the policy of the ChatGPT plan and settings you choose.

## Why This Works Better Than Dashboards

Dashboards solve the human viewing problem. They put multiple data sources on one screen. But they do not solve the AI access problem. ChatGPT still cannot see the dashboard.

And dashboards create their own issues. Each tool defines metrics differently. The Shopify revenue number and the QuickBooks revenue number are different numbers. The dashboard shows both but cannot tell you which one is right or why they differ.

Direct AI access solves this differently. The AI queries both Shopify and QuickBooks. It reconciles the definitions. It tells you the number and explains any differences. It does the thinking, not just the displaying.

## What to Look For

When evaluating ways to connect business data to ChatGPT, look for:

**Read-only access**: The connection should never allow the AI to modify your data. No creating orders, no changing financials, no sending emails.

**Per-source authentication**: Each tool should authenticate independently. Shopify via your Shopify login. QuickBooks via your Intuit login. No shared credentials.

**Source citations**: Every number should trace back to its origin. "Revenue: $142K - Shopify $89K, Stripe $38K, QuickBooks $15K." Without citations, you are still guessing.

**Cross-AI compatibility**: The same connection should work with Claude, Perplexity, and other AIs. You should get the same answer regardless of which AI you use.

## The Bottom Line

Your AI is only as smart as the data it can access. Give it real access to your business tools and it becomes a business intelligence system. Keep it disconnected and it remains a writing assistant that happens to know about business.

The difference is not the model. It is the pipeline.
