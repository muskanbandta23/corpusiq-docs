# Hermes Improvement Pipeline - August 2026

Tools and methodologies that can make Hermes agents faster, smarter, and more reliable. Discovered through proactive GitHub research.

## Microsoft Skill Recorder ⭐2,799

Desktop app that records on-screen work sessions and converts them into reusable agent skills. Currently built for GitHub Copilot CLI but the pattern is universal.

**How it works**: Start recording. Do the task once. The recorder captures every click, terminal command, and browser action. Outputs a structured skill that future agents can replay.

**Application to Hermes**: Hermes skills are currently written manually in markdown. A recording tool would make skill creation 10x faster. Instead of documenting the Reddit commenting workflow, record one successful session and generate the skill automatically.

**Integration path**: Adapt the recording format to output Hermes SKILL.md files with frontmatter. The recording format (action sequences with selectors and delays) maps directly to Hermes skill steps.

## Fable Method ⭐2,192

The workflow that Claude Fable 5 used, distilled into model-agnostic skills. Key principles:

1. **Read the whole context before acting** - matches our Aug 5 hard rule
2. **Assert, don't explain** - matches the corpusiq-content-writing-system communication philosophy
3. **Start with the point** - the argument proves itself
4. **End on a line that stands alone** - the mic drop

**Application to Hermes**: The Fable method aligns with every content rule established for CorpusIQ. It should be integrated into the corpusiq-content-writing-system skill as a foundational framework.

## Human Writing ⭐2,254

AI writing skill that makes Chinese text read like a real person. The pattern is universal: strip AI-isms, add voice quirks, vary sentence length, use concrete examples.

**Application**: Our content rules already enforce de-AI-fication (no em dashes, no buzzwords, prose-first). This skill provides a systematic framework for voice injection that could make the preflight gate more sophisticated.

## Interface-Building Skills ⭐3,332

Collection of agent skills for building interfaces. Covers component selection, layout patterns, and animation principles.

**Application**: The Hermes desktop app and dashboard could benefit from these patterns. Automated UI generation from agent skills would make the audit and monitoring dashboards more polished.

## Next Steps

1. Test skill-recorder on a Reddit commenting session - if it works, we have automated skill creation
2. Integrate Fable Method principles into content writing system
3. Adapt human-writing voice injection patterns for our preflight gate
4. Explore interface-building skills for Hermes dashboard improvements

The goal: every week, find one new tool or methodology that makes the system 5 percent better. Compound that over 52 weeks and the system is 12x more capable.
