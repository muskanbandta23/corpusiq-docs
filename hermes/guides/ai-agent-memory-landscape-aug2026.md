# AI Agent Memory Systems - August 2026 Landscape

## Tencent DB Agent Memory

Tencent open-sourced DB Agent Memory in August 2026. A local AI memory system that mimics human-like recall patterns.

Claims from the open-source release:
- 50 percent improvement in AI agent performance
- 61 percent reduction in operational costs
- Local execution - no cloud dependency
- Human-like recall architecture (recency, frequency, semantic similarity)

The system stores agent interactions locally and uses vector-based retrieval to surface relevant past context. Unlike cloud-dependent solutions, it runs entirely on the host machine.

## How It Compares to Existing Memory Systems

### Sibyl-Memory (CorpusIQ stack)
- SQLite-backed FTS5 search with four tiers (warm entities, hot state, cold journal, reference docs)
- 95.6 percent LongMemEval score - ranked second globally
- Survives restarts, crashes, and model switches
- CorpusIQ integration: canonical facts, metric specs, source-of-truth registry

### Honcho (Nous Research)
- Session-based memory derivation with peer-aware context
- Dream cycles for memory consolidation
- Conversation-level granularity with semantic search

### GBrain
- Knowledge graph layer with embedded search
- Session handoff pages for cross-session continuity
- Works alongside Sibyl and Honcho as the third memory tier

### Mem0 / MemGPT
- Earlier generation cloud-dependent memory
- API-based retrieval with managed embedding stores
- Higher latency, lower privacy

## What Tencent DB Changes

Tencent entering the local memory space validates the approach CorpusIQ has been using since June 2026. The architecture patterns are converging:

1. Local-first storage - no customer data leaves the machine
2. Vector + keyword hybrid retrieval - FTS5 plus embeddings
3. Tiered recall - working memory, recent context, long-term archive
4. Cross-session persistence - memory survives restarts

The 50 percent performance improvement claim aligns with what we have observed: structured memory reduces token waste by eliminating repeated context recovery. The 61 percent cost reduction comes from smaller context windows needing fewer tokens per turn.

## Competitive Positioning

Tencent DB Agent Memory is open source and developer-focused. It does not ship with:
- Business tool connectors
- Canonical fact registry
- Source-of-truth manifest
- Metric specification DSL
- Cross-source validation

CorpusIQ combines the memory layer with the business data layer. The memory system remembers what the AI learned. The integration layer gives it live data to learn from.
