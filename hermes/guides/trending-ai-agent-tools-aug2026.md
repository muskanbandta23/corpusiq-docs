# Trending AI Agent Tools - August 2026

Weekly scan of new open-source AI agent tools worth investigating for Hermes and CorpusIQ.

## Caspian SDK - Agent Communication Layer

⭐ 608 stars. Open-source agent communication layer. Handles email, WhatsApp, and other message channels for AI agents. This is an agent-to-agent and agent-to-human communication framework.

**Why it matters for Hermes**: Hermes currently sends emails and messages through platform connectors. Caspian provides a standardized communication layer that could simplify multi-channel delivery. Instead of maintaining separate Gmail API, Telegram bot, and Discord webhook integrations, a single agent communication SDK handles all channels.

**Integration path**: Caspian could become a Hermes plugin or MCP server. Install once. Configure channels once. Every Hermes agent inherits the communication layer.

## Vibe-Research - Personal Trading Research Agent

⭐ 1,946 stars. Local-first trading research agent. Covers A-stock (China), US stocks, and HK stocks with daily recaps, news radar, individual stock data, sector centers, and portfolio tracking.

**Why it matters for CorpusIQ**: This is a domain-specific AI agent that pulls data from multiple financial sources. The architecture mirrors CorpusIQ's approach: connect disparate data sources, give the AI a unified query layer, deliver trusted answers. The trading-specific UI patterns (portfolio dashboard, daily recap cards, news radar) are design references for CorpusIQ's business intelligence display layer.

## Open Science - Model-Agnostic Research Workbench

⭐ 1,861 stars. Open-source, local-first, model-agnostic AI research workbench. Works across macOS, Windows, and Linux. Designed for scientific discovery but applicable to any multi-source research workflow.

**Why it matters for Hermes**: The model-agnostic local architecture is the same pattern Hermes uses (DeepSeek primary, Claude fallback, Qwen local). Open Science's workbench UI for multi-model research could inform Hermes desktop improvements.

## OpenChatCut - Conversational AI Video Editor

⭐ 926 stars. Open-source, local-first conversational AI video editor with professional multi-track timeline. Lets users edit video by talking to an AI agent.

**Why it matters for Hermes**: This is a practical application of agent-driven creative work. The conversational editing pattern (describe what you want, AI executes) is directly applicable to Hermes's vision of agent-driven business operations. Instead of configuring dashboards, you describe what you need.

## Key Pattern Across All Four

Every trending tool share three characteristics:

1. **Local-first architecture** - data stays on the user's machine
2. **Model-agnostic** - works with any LLM provider
3. **Conversational interface** - users describe intent, the AI executes

This is the same pattern Hermes and CorpusIQ follow. The ecosystem is converging on local-first, model-flexible, conversation-driven tools. The winners will be the ones with the deepest data integration layer.

CorpusIQ is that integration layer for business data.
