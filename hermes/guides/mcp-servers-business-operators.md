# 7 MCP Servers for Business Operators - August 2026

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) lets AI assistants connect to external tools. Here are the MCP servers worth knowing if you run a business.

## 1. CorpusIQ - Business Intelligence

Connect 40+ business tools to any AI. Shopify, Stripe, QuickBooks, GA4, Meta Ads. Read-only OAuth. Source-cited answers. Same number in ChatGPT, Claude, and Perplexity. Every time.

- **Use case**: "What was our revenue last week?" - answered from live data
- **Website**: [corpusiq.io](https://corpusiq.io)
- **GitHub**: [CorpusIQ/corpusiq-docs](https://github.com/CorpusIQ/corpusiq-docs)

## 2. Exa - Real-Time Search

Gives AI access to web search with semantic understanding. Not keyword matching - meaning-based retrieval. Finds content your AI would otherwise miss.

- **Use case**: Research competitors, find market data, discover prospects
- **Website**: [exa.ai](https://exa.ai)

## 3. Browserbase - Web Automation

Lets AI control a real browser. Fill forms, scrape pages, take screenshots. Handles CAPTCHAs and JavaScript rendering.

- **Use case**: Extract data from websites that block traditional scrapers
- **Website**: [browserbase.com](https://browserbase.com)

## 4. Slack MCP - Workplace Communication

Connect AI to your Slack workspace. Read channels, send messages, search conversations. Turns AI into a team member.

- **Use case**: Ask AI to summarize a channel's activity or find that one message from last month
- **GitHub**: [modelcontextprotocol/servers](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers)

## 5. GitHub MCP - Code & Issues

Give AI access to your repos. Read code, manage issues, review PRs. AI as a developer on your team.

- **Use case**: "What PRs are waiting for review?" or "Summarize last week's commits"
- **GitHub**: [github.com/github/github-mcp-server](https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server)

## 6. Google Drive MCP - Documents & Sheets

AI reads your docs, sheets, and slides. Search across your entire Drive. Summarize documents without opening them.

- **Use case**: "What were the key points from last quarter's board deck?"
- **GitHub**: [modelcontextprotocol/servers](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers)

## 7. PostgreSQL MCP - Database Queries

Connect AI directly to your database. Ask questions in English, get SQL results. Read-only mode available.

- **Use case**: "Show me customers who haven't ordered in 90 days"
- **GitHub**: [modelcontextprotocol/servers](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers)

## How to Use These Together

The real power is combining them. Ask one question that spans multiple servers:

> "Find our top 10 customers by revenue (CorpusIQ → Stripe), check if they have open support tickets (CorpusIQ → HubSpot), and draft a personal check-in email for each (Claude + your context)."

That is not a feature. That is an operating system for your business.
