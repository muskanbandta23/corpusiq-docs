## How They Work Together

### Without CorpusIQ
> *agency-agents* gives you brilliant system prompts. The Content Creator writes great copy. The Social Media Strategist plans campaigns. But they can't see your real data. They don't know what's in your Gmail, your Shopify orders, your Stripe payments, your HubSpot deals. They're brilliant personalities working in the dark.

### With CorpusIQ
> The Content Creator gets your actual customer emails and product data. The Growth Hacker sees your real funnel metrics. The Social Media Strategist pulls your actual engagement data. Every agent has access to cited answers from your connected tools - not generic knowledge, YOUR data.

## Why This Matters

**The AI agent market is splitting in two:**

1. **Personality companies** - sell prompt files. Text. Brilliant personas, but no real-world data access.
2. **Infrastructure companies** - sell connectors. Pipes to your tools, but no personality.

**CorpusIQ + agency-agents is the only stack that does both.** 232 personalities. 40+ live connectors. One runtime.

One gives you the agents. The other connects them to your real business.
