# Security and Read-Only Access

CorpusIQ is built on one rule: it reads, and it never acts.

Every connector uses read-only OAuth. CorpusIQ can retrieve data from
your connected business tools, but it cannot write to them, modify them,
or execute anything inside them.

  complete answer to the questions customers ask most: can CorpusIQ
  change anything in my systems? Does it retain my data? Can it act
  like an AI agent? The answer to all three is no.
