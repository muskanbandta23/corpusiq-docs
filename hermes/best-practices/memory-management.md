# Memory Management Best Practices  --  Persistent AI Agent Context

Memory is what separates a stateless tool from a persistent AI assistant in Hermes Agent. But memory also consumes context, increases latency, and introduces staleness risks. These memory management best practices cover when and how to use each memory tier for optimal agent performance.

## Overview

Hermes Agent provides a [triple-stack memory architecture](/hermes/knowledge/): **Honcho** for peer identity and preferences, **GBrain** for organizational knowledge indexing, and **memcore-cloud** for cross-session conversation recall. Each solves a different problem, and production deployments run all three.

## How It Works

### The Memory Hierarchy

| Tier | System | Use Case | Persistence |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Peer Memory** | [Honcho](/hermes/knowledge/) | User identity, preferences, bans, decisions | Cross-session |
| **Organizational** | [GBrain](/hermes/knowledge/) | File/code indexing, project relationships | Cross-session |
| **Cross-Session** | [memcore-cloud](/hermes/knowledge/) | Full conversation recall with source tracking | Cross-session |
| **Conversation** | In-session context | Task continuity within current chat | Ephemeral |
| **Procedural** | [Skills](/hermes/skills/creating-skills/) | Reusable workflows, tool chains | Versioned |

## When to Add Memory

Ask these questions before storing:

- **Does this fact change rarely?** Stable preferences → memory. Current task focus → conversation context.
- **Is it referenced across sessions?** Multi-session project → memory. One-off question → don't store.
- **Does it save meaningful context tokens?** If storing saves re-explaining each session, it's worth it.
- **Is it factual or procedural?** Facts → memories. Workflows → [skills](/hermes/skills/creating-skills/). Config → [env vars](/hermes/best-practices/security/).

## Compaction Strategies

When context windows fill up:

- **Sliding window**: Keep last N messages verbatim; summarize older. Best for linear task-focused conversations.
- **Hierarchical summarization**: Summarize sections into bullet points; summarize summaries when chain gets long.
- **Selective retention**: Flag key decisions/code to "keep forever"; summarize everything else.
- **Semantic retrieval**: Index conversation turns by embedding; retrieve relevant chunks on demand.

## Memory Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Why It Hurts | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Memory as dumping ground | 500 stale entries = noise | Prune periodically |
| Contradictory memories | Confusion across sessions | Audit for conflicts |
| No expiration | "Working on Q2 report" stale in Q3 | Add implicit/project expiry |
| Memory replacing config | API keys in memory = breach | Use [secrets manager](/hermes/best-practices/security/) |

## Benefits

- **No session amnesia**: Agents remember who you are, what you're building, and what happened last session
- **Reduced re-explanation**: Stable preferences stored once, referenced forever
- **Faster onboarding**: Team knowledge indexed and queryable via GBrain
- **Lower token costs**: Compacted context means less wasted context window

## FAQ

### What's the difference between Honcho and GBrain memory?
Honcho stores peer identity  --  who the user is, preferences, decisions, bans. GBrain indexes organizational knowledge  --  where files are, what code does what, project relationships. They solve different problems and should both be used in production.

### How do I prevent my Hermes Agent memory from getting stale?
Prune memories periodically (monthly review), add expiration to project-specific memories, audit for contradictions, and use the dream cycle (nightly consolidation) to merge duplicates and strengthen frequently accessed paths.

### Can I use just one memory system?
You can, but you'll have gaps. [Honcho only](/hermes/knowledge/) handles peer modeling but not file indexing. [GBrain only](/hermes/knowledge/) handles code/docs but not "who is the user?". Run the full triple stack for complete agent memory.
