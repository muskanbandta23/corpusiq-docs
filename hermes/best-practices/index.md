# Hermes Agent Best Practices  --  Build Reliable AI Automation

Hermes Agent best practices capture what the community has learned about building reliable, secure, and maintainable AI agent setups. Whether you're running your first cron or managing a team deployment, these best practices help you avoid the mistakes we've already made in production.

## Overview

This guide serves as the entry point to the Hermes Agent best practices collection. Each companion guide (cron design, model selection, memory management, security, skill development, MCP design) stands alone  --  read the ones relevant to your current work.

## How It Works

The best practices follow four core principles that apply across every aspect of Hermes Agent operation:

**Explicit over implicit.** Hermes Agent should do what you told it to do, not what it guessed you meant. Explicit tools, explicit permissions, explicit confirmations. The best Hermes setup is the one where you never wonder "why did it do that?"

**Observable over magical.** Every automated decision should be traceable. Every cron should log its work. Every skill invocation should leave an audit trail. Debugging a Hermes pipeline should be a matter of reading logs, not guessing.

**Composable over monolithic.** Small, focused skills compose into powerful workflows. A single "do everything" skill is brittle. Five well-scoped skills that chain together are flexible and testable.

**Least privilege by default.** Start with read-only access. Add write capabilities only when the use case demands it. Add approval gates before write capabilities go live.

## Anti-Patterns Quick Reference

These patterns cause the majority of production incidents. Avoid them.

| Anti-Pattern | Why It Hurts | What to Do Instead |
|---|---|---|
| Hardcoded credentials in skills | Breach on first share | [Security best practices](security.md)  --  secrets manager or env vars |
| God crons that do everything | One failure cascades | [Cron design](cron-design.md)  --  single-responsibility crons |
| Silent error swallowing | False confidence | Alert on persistent failure |
| No approval on write ops | Unintended external actions | [Security](security.md)  --  tiered confirmation gates |
| Unbounded database queries | Timeouts, resource exhaustion | Pagination and limits |
| Memory as dumping ground | Context pollution, staleness | [Memory management](memory-management.md)  --  curated, pruned memories |
| Copy-pasted skill logic | Bug propagation | [Skill development](skill-development.md)  --  shared utility skills |
| Console-only logging | No audit trail | Structured persistent logging |
| Auto-updating dependencies | Supply-chain risk | Version pinning in production |
| Model selection by habit | Cost/latency waste | [Model selection](model-selection.md)  --  task-aware routing |

## Maturity Model

### Level 1: Getting Started
- Running ad-hoc queries through chat interface
- No persistent memory or skills configured
- One or two connectors (email, calendar)
- Manual model selection, default settings
- **Next:** Identify a repeatable task to turn into a skill

### Level 2: Structured Usage
- 3-5 skills for common workflows
- Basic memory (user preferences, project context)
- Connectors for major data sources
- Manual cron execution
- **Next:** Automate the most valuable recurring task with cron

### Level 3: Automated Operations
- Scheduled crons for monitoring, reporting, routine tasks
- Tiered model selection ([guide](model-selection.md))
- Error handling with retry and alerting
- Skills published within team with documentation
- Approval gates on all write operations
- **Next:** Cross-team skill sharing and review process

### Level 4: Team-Scale Deployment
- 15+ production skills by multiple team members
- Automated model selection with fallback chains
- Comprehensive monitoring for all crons
- Weekly audit log review
- Credential rotation schedule
- **Next:** Contribute to MCP ecosystem, mentor new users

### Level 5: Platform Integration
- Hermes in CI/CD, deployment, incident response
- Custom MCP servers ([guide](mcp-design.md)) for internal systems
- Team-wide memory management ([guide](memory-management.md))
- Capacity planning and cost optimization
- Quarterly security compliance reviews
- **Next:** Publish case studies, shape the roadmap

## Benefits of Following Best Practices

- **Fewer production incidents**: Anti-patterns document common failure modes before you hit them
- **Faster onboarding**: Standardized practices mean new team members contribute faster
- **Lower costs**: [Model selection](model-selection.md) and [cron design](cron-design.md) prevent waste
- **Better security posture**: [Least-privilege patterns](security.md) reduce breach surface
- **Community alignment**: Skills and MCP servers interoperate when following shared conventions

## Navigating the Best Practices

- **[Cron Design](cron-design.md):** Idempotency, error handling, rate limiting, monitoring for scheduled automation
- **[Model Selection](model-selection.md):** When to use which model, cost optimization, fallback chains
- **[Memory Management](memory-management.md):** Memory systems, compaction strategies, context optimization
- **[Security](security.md):** Token management, least privilege, approval gates, audit logging
- **[Skill Development](skill-development.md):** Skill design, testing, documentation, lifecycle management
- **[MCP Design](mcp-design.md):** MCP server development, tool design, error handling, testing

## FAQ

### What is the most important Hermes Agent best practice?
Start with least-privilege access (read-only) and add write capabilities only when needed with explicit approval gates. This single practice prevents the majority of production incidents.

### How do I know if my Hermes Agent setup is production-ready?
Check against the [maturity model](index.md#maturity-model). At minimum, you should have structured logging, error handling with retries, approval gates on writes, and at least one week of error-free operation.

### Should I use local or cloud models for production?
Use a hybrid approach: local models for classification, extraction, and routine tasks (free, private); cloud models for complex reasoning. See the [model selection guide](model-selection.md) for task-to-model mapping.

### How do I prevent cron jobs from causing problems?
Follow [cron design best practices](cron-design.md): make every cron idempotent, implement retry with backoff, alert on persistent failure, and never run unbounded queries.
