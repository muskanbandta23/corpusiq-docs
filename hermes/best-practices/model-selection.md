# Model Selection Guide  --  Choose the Right AI Model Every Time

Choosing the right model for each task is one of the highest-leverage decisions you make with Hermes Agent. A well-chosen model saves latency, cost, and context  --  missteps waste all three. This model selection guide covers task-to-model mapping, cost optimization, local vs cloud tradeoffs, and fallback chain patterns.

## Overview

Hermes Agent supports 200+ models across Ollama (local), OpenRouter, and direct provider APIs. Following [best practices](/hermes/best-practices/) for model selection means using the cheapest model that reliably handles each task, reserving frontier models for complex reasoning.

## How It Works

### The Decision Framework

Ask three questions before every model selection:

1. **What does the task require?**  --  Reasoning depth, factual precision, creative generation, or tool orchestration?
2. **What is the latency budget?**  --  Real-time interaction, batch processing, or background work?
3. **What is the cost tolerance?**  --  Per-request budget, daily volume, or fixed monthly spend?

### Task-to-Model Mapping

| Task Type | Model Tier | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| Classification & Routing | Small/Lightweight | Intent detection, email triage, field extraction |
| Data Extraction & Summarization | Mid-tier | Meeting transcripts, action items, structured data |
| Complex Reasoning & Code | Frontier | Multi-step debugging, architecture decisions |
| Creative & Narrative | Style-appropriate | Brand content, brainstorming (test with audience) |

## Cost Optimization Strategies

**Caching.** If 40% of your queries are variants of the same 5 intents, cache results before hitting models.

**Prompt compression.** Summarize conversation history before expensive calls. Strip irrelevant tool output.

**Task batching.** Process similar records together  --  many providers offer 50% discounts on batch endpoints.

**Model fallback chains.** Try cheapest model first → if confidence low, escalate to mid-tier → if still uncertain, invoke frontier. This "progressive enhancement" gives frontier quality on hard cases while keeping average cost low.

## Local vs Cloud: The Real Tradeoffs

**Local models (Ollama) win when:** data privacy is non-negotiable, latency must be sub-50ms, high volume makes fixed hardware cost cheaper than per-token pricing. See [gaming PC setup](/hermes/setup/gaming-pc/) or [Mac Mini setup](/hermes/setup/mac-mini-standalone/).

**Cloud models (OpenRouter/Anthropic/OpenAI) win when:** you need frontier reasoning, zero infrastructure maintenance, elastic scaling. See [cloud VPS setup](/hermes/setup/cloud-vps/).

**Hybrid for most teams:** Classify/extract with local models (free, private); reason/generate with cloud models. Configure Hermes Agent with [Ollama as primary and OpenRouter as fallback](/hermes/setup/).

## The Fallback Chain Pattern

1. **Check cache**  --  identical query answered recently? Return cached.
2. **Try primary model**  --  send to default model for this task class
3. **Validate output**  --  check structure, completeness, confidence
4. **Escalate if needed**  --  retry with stronger model
5. **Track fallback rate**  --  if >10%, primary model is too weak

## Practical Decision Tree

```
Classification/routing? → Small model
Data extraction from known formats? → Mid-tier
Summarization of medium-length text? → Mid-tier
Multi-step reasoning or debugging? → Frontier
Creative writing or brand content? → Style-appropriate (test!)
Background batch job? → Cheapest reliable model
Latency critical (sub-second)? → Local or fastest cloud
Data sensitive/regulated? → Local or approved cloud with BAA
```

## Benefits

- **3-10x cost reduction**: Use small models for 80% of routine tasks
- **Lower latency**: Local models for classification give sub-second responses
- **Privacy by default**: Sensitive data stays on local models
- **Frontier quality on demand**: Fallback chains escalate only when needed

## FAQ

### When should I use a local model vs a cloud model?
Use local models (Ollama) for classification, extraction, and data-sensitive tasks  --  they're free and private. Use cloud models for complex reasoning, code generation, and tasks requiring frontier capabilities. Most teams benefit from a [hybrid approach](/hermes/setup/).

### How do I reduce my API costs with Hermes Agent?
Implement caching for repeated queries, use prompt compression before expensive calls, batch non-urgent tasks, and create fallback chains that try cheaper models first. Track cost per successful task, not per token.

### What's the best model for code generation?
Frontier models like Claude Sonnet 4, GPT-4o, and DeepSeek V3 excel at code generation. For boilerplate or simple functions, smaller local models like CodeLlama or DeepSeek Coder handle it efficiently at zero cost.
