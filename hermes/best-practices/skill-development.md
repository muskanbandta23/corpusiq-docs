# Skill Development Guide  --  Build Reusable AI Agent Skills

Skills are Hermes Agent's superpower  --  they encode repeatable expertise into reusable, shareable packages. A well-written skill transforms "I need to do X" into a single invocation that handles tool orchestration, error recovery, and output formatting. This skill development guide covers everything from your first SKILL.md to publishing.

## Overview

Custom skills capture repeatable workflows  --  tool calls, validations, and output formatting  --  into a package you, your team, or the community can reuse. Following [best practices](/hermes/best-practices/) for skill development ensures your skills are testable, maintainable, and production-ready.

## How It Works

### The Rule of Three

Before creating a skill, perform the task manually at least three times:
1. **First time:** Learn what's needed
2. **Second time:** Refine your approach
3. **Third time:** Encode the pattern as a skill

### SKILL.md Anatomy

```yaml
---
name: my-skill-name
description: One-sentence purpose
version: 1.0.0
author: your-handle
tags: [tag1, tag2]
required_connectors: [connector-a]
quality_tier: beta
---
```

Followed by: What This Skill Does, When to Use, Required Setup, Step-by-Step Workflow (with error handling per step), Example Output, Troubleshooting, Changelog.

### Trigger Patterns

Write 5-10 trigger patterns covering different ways users might ask. **Good:** "Check our marketing performance this week"  --  specific enough to avoid false positives but broad enough to catch real intent. **Bad:** "marketing" (too broad) or overly specific variations.

### Verification Between Steps

- **Schema verification:** Does response have expected shape?
- **Completeness verification:** Did you get everything?
- **Freshness verification:** Is data current?
- **Business rule verification:** Are values in expected ranges?

### Error Recovery Patterns

- **Transient errors:** Retry with exponential backoff (max 3 attempts, include jitter)
- **Auth errors:** Don't retry  --  return clear re-auth message
- **Data errors:** Return partial results with clear caveats
- **Partial failures:** Return successes + failure summary

## Testing Methodology

| Test Type | What to Test |
|---|---|
| **Unit** | Each step in isolation with mock inputs |
| **Happy path** | Full end-to-end with known-good data |
| **Edge cases** | Empty data, maximum data, missing fields, special characters, date boundaries |
| **Error injection** | Disconnect connector, malformed data, rate limits, invalid params |
| **Regression** | Re-run full suite after any change; weekly smoke test for production skills |

## Skill Lifecycle

**Draft** → **Beta** (tested by author + 1 other) → **Production** (2+ weeks stable) → **Deprecated** (replacement exists, 30-90 day migration) → **Archived**

## Benefits

- **Knowledge transfer**: Skills encode institutional knowledge without requiring prompt engineering
- **Error reduction**: Consistent validation and error handling applied every time
- **Team scaling**: One well-tested skill serves the entire team
- **Community contribution**: Share what you build; benefit from others' work

## FAQ

### When should I create a Hermes Agent skill vs using a prompt?
Create a skill when you've done the task 3+ times manually, it involves multiple tool calls, it needs guardrails (validation, approval gates), or someone else needs to do it. Use prompts for one-off or exploratory tasks.

### How do I test a Hermes Agent skill before publishing?
Test each step in isolation with mock data, run the full workflow end-to-end, test edge cases (empty/maximum/malformed data), deliberately inject errors, and re-run the full suite after any change. Schedule weekly smoke tests for production skills.

### What makes a good trigger pattern for skills?
Good triggers are specific enough to avoid false positives but broad enough to catch natural variations. Write 5-10 patterns covering different formality levels, time windows, and specificity. Avoid single-word triggers and overly specific patterns.
