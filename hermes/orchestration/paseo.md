# Paseo  --  Cross-Session Agent Orchestration

Paseo (getpaseo/paseo) is a self-hosted orchestration layer for coding agents. It runs a local daemon that manages multiple agents in parallel, and exposes one interface across desktop, mobile, web, and CLI. It fills the gap between single-session agent loops and full platform orchestration: you spin agents up, watch them work, attach to live output, and send follow-up tasks without opening a terminal per agent.

## Why It Matters

Single-session agent patterns break when you need several agents working at once. Paseo's model is a reference for the orchestration stack:

- One daemon owns all agent lifecycles.
- Clients connect to the daemon, so state survives across devices and sessions.
- Agents run on your own machine with your full dev environment: your tools, your configs, your skills.
- Multi-provider: Claude Code, Codex, Copilot, OpenCode, and Pi through the same interface.
- No telemetry, no tracking, no forced log-in.

## License Verdict

The GitHub API classifies the license as `NOASSERTION`, but the LICENSE file's own terms are **Apache License 2.0** (with third-party components remaining under their respective licenses). The NOASSERTION flag is a classifier artifact caused by the custom preamble header, not a custom or restrictive license. Apache 2.0 is permissive: use, modify, and distribute freely, including commercially, with attribution.

## Architecture

```
Desktop / Mobile / Web / CLI clients
              │
              ▼
         Paseo daemon  (local server, manages agent lifecycles)
              │
   ┌──────────┼──────────────┬───────────────┐
   ▼          ▼              ▼               ▼
Claude Code  Codex       Copilot        OpenCode / Pi
```

The daemon is the single source of truth. Clients pair to it locally, over TCP, or through the end-to-end encrypted relay for device pairing.

## Setup

### CLI / headless

```bash
npm install -g @getpaseo/cli
paseo
```

Paseo starts locally, then asks whether to enable the end-to-end encrypted relay for device pairing. If you decline, connect directly over TCP, Tailscale, or another VPN. This path is useful for servers and remote machines.

### Docker

Run the daemon and self-hosted web UI in a container:

```bash
docker run -d --name paseo \
  -p 6767:6767 \
  -e PASEO_PASSWORD=change-me \
  -v "$PWD/paseo-home:/home/paseo" \
  -v "$PWD:/workspace" \
  ghcr.io/getpaseo/paseo:latest
```

Open `http://localhost:6767` after it starts. Extend the base image with the agent CLIs you use, then provide credentials through environment variables or the persistent `/home/paseo` volume.

### Desktop app

Download from [paseo.sh/download](https://paseo.sh/download) or the GitHub releases page. The app starts the daemon automatically. To connect from your phone: Settings → your host → Pair Device.

## CLI Reference

```bash
paseo run --provider claude/opus-4.6 "implement user authentication"
paseo run --provider codex/gpt-5.5 --worktree feature-x "implement feature X"

paseo ls                           # list running agents
paseo attach abc123                # stream live output
paseo send abc123 "also add tests" # follow-up task

# run on a remote daemon; --cwd is a path on that host
paseo run --host workstation.local:6767 --cwd /workspace "run the full test suite"
```

## Evaluation Notes (2026-08-30)

- **Stars / forks / issues:** 15.5K stars, 1.7K forks, 1.1K open issues at time of review.
- **Velocity:** very active, multiple commits per day, 4,000+ merged PRs since creation (Oct 2025).
- **Language:** TypeScript.
- **Repo:** https://github.com/getpaseo/paseo · Docs: https://paseo.sh/docs
- **Watch items:** the issue backlog is large relative to project age; verify release stability before relying on it for production workloads.

## Fit With This Stack

Paseo complements the orchestration layers documented in this section. It is not a replacement for an execution kernel like Hermes; it is a reference implementation of the cross-session control plane: one daemon, many agents, many clients. Teams that run several coding agents on shared infrastructure should evaluate it as the coordination surface.
