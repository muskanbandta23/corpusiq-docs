# Orchestration

A six-layer orchestration stack that moves agents from single-task executors to autonomous operators.

```
Layer 1: Hermes Agent      →  Execution kernel (tool loop, skills, session mgmt)
Layer 2: CrewAI            →  Multi-agent coordination (delegate, parallel work)
Layer 3: LangGraph         →  Stateful workflows (checkpoints, conditional routing)
Layer 4: Reflexion         →  Self-improvement loops (evaluate, reflect, retry)
Layer 5: Cron + Scheduling →  Persistent operations (24 recurring jobs)
Layer 6: Governance        →  Safety rules, monitoring, drift detection
```

## Pages

| Framework | What It Does | Doc |
|-----------|-------------|-----|
| **Hermes Agent** | Execution kernel  --  tool loop, skills loading, session management, model routing | [Read →](/hermes/orchestration/hermes/) |
| **CrewAI** | Multi-agent coordination  --  task delegation, parallel workstreams, agent roles | [Read →](/hermes/orchestration/crewai/) |
| **LangGraph** | Stateful graph workflows  --  checkpoints, conditional routing, subgraph isolation | [Read →](/hermes/orchestration/langgraph/) |
| **Reflexion** | Self-improving loops  --  evaluation, reflection, memory, iterative improvement | [Read →](/hermes/orchestration/reflexion/) |
| **Paseo** | Cross-session agent orchestration  --  daemon-managed coding agents, multi-provider, one surface | [Read →](/hermes/orchestration/paseo/) |

## Why This Stack

Single-agent chat patterns break at scale. Agents need:
- **Memory**: What happened last session? (GBrain, Honcho)
- **Coordination**: Who does what? (CrewAI, LangGraph)
- **Improvement**: Did that work? (Reflexion)
- **Persistence**: Run without me watching? (Cron, governance)

This stack answers all four.
