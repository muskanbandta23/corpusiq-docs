# How Business AI Agents Handle Data Access - The Infrastructure Layer

Every business owner who has tried asking ChatGPT about their revenue has hit the same wall. The AI is capable. The data is there. But there is no pipe between them.

## The Three-Layer Stack

Business AI data access needs three layers:

### Layer 1: Connectors

Raw API integrations. OAuth to Shopify. API key to Stripe. Service account to GA4. Each connector handles authentication, rate limiting, error retry, and data normalization independently. No shared session. No cross-contamination.

This is where most platforms stop. They give you connectors and call it done. But connectors alone do not answer business questions. They return raw data.

### Layer 2: Resolution

When a user asks "what was revenue last month," the system must resolve that question across multiple connectors. Shopify has orders. Stripe has payments. QuickBooks has invoices. Each defines revenue differently. Each has different date boundaries.

Resolution means:
- Mapping the business question to connector-specific queries
- Normalizing date ranges across timezone-aware systems
- Resolving entity conflicts (is this Shopify customer the same as this QuickBooks customer?)
- Merging results without double-counting

This layer is what makes "one answer" possible across multiple sources.

### Layer 3: Validation

Every answer must trace back to its source. "Revenue was $142,000 last month" is useless without "Shopify: $89,000 (1,247 orders), Stripe: $38,000 (subscriptions), QuickBooks: $15,000 (consulting invoices)."

Validation means:
- Source citations on every number
- Conflict detection (Shopify says $89K, Stripe says $86K for the same period)
- Audit trail from answer back to raw API response

## Why Stateless Matters

The stateless MCP specification (July 2026) makes this architecture practical at scale. Every connector call is a discrete HTTP request with its own authentication. No sessions. No connection state. No sticky routing.

If a connector goes down, the others keep working. If a user switches from ChatGPT to Claude mid-session, the same connector serves both. The data layer is independent of the AI layer.

## What This Means for Business Operators

You should be able to ask your AI anything about your business and get the same answer regardless of which AI you use. The number should not change when you switch from ChatGPT to Claude. The confidence should not depend on which tool you opened first.

This requires infrastructure that connects your actual business tools to AI - not a dashboard, not a CSV export, not a manual reconciliation. Infrastructure that lives between your data and your AI, invisible and consistent.

## The Alternative

Without this layer, every AI answer about your business is an educated guess. The AI might be right. It might be close. But you cannot prove it and you cannot rely on it. The numbers change when you switch tools. The confidence is fake.

That is not an AI problem. It is an infrastructure problem.
