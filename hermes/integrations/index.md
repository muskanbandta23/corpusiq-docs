# Hermes Agent Integration Examples  --  Connect Your Business Tools

## What's Inside

| Integration | File | Core Value |
|---|---|---|
| Slack + GitHub | `slack-github.md` | PR notifications, issue tracking, deployment alerts |
| Email + Calendar | `email-calendar.md` | Meeting scheduling, follow-ups, availability management |
| CRM + Analytics | `crm-analytics.md` | Lead scoring, pipeline forecasting, attribution |
| Database + Reporting | `database-reporting.md` | Scheduled queries, dashboards, anomaly detection |

## Common Architecture Patterns

Every integration in this collection follows a consistent architectural pattern:

### The Three-Layer Model

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                 SOURCE LAYER                     │
│  (Data producers: GitHub, CRM, Email, DB)       │
└────────────────────┬────────────────────────────┘
                     │ MCP Server (read-only tools)
┌────────────────────▼────────────────────────────┐
│              AUTOMATION LAYER                    │
│  Hermes Agent + Cron Scheduler                  │
│  - Query source systems on schedule             │
│  - Compute, enrich, detect anomalies            │
│  - Format output for destinations               │
└────────────────────┬────────────────────────────┘
                     │ MCP Server / API calls
┌────────────────────▼────────────────────────────┐
│              DESTINATION LAYER                   │
│  (Action takers: Slack, Calendar, Sheets,       │
│   Notion, Email, CRM write-backs)               │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Key Design Principles

**1. Read-Heavy, Write-Cautious**
Source systems are accessed with read-only credentials. Destinations receive writes only for well-defined, low-risk operations (posting a Slack message, updating a spreadsheet cell). Autonomous destructive actions (deleting records, sending external emails, modifying production configs) require explicit human approval gating.

**2. Cron as the Orchestrator**
Cron expressions are the heartbeat of integrations. Each automation runs on a defined schedule appropriate to its urgency:

| Urgency | Cron Cadence | Use Cases |
|---|---|---|
| Near real-time | `*/5 * * * *` or `*/10 * * * *` | Incident detection, deployment monitoring |
| Hourly | `0 * * * *` | Traffic check, error rate monitoring |
| Daily | `0 7 * * *` | Morning briefings, daily reports |
| Weekly | `0 8 * * 1` | Pipeline forecasts, weekly roundups |
| Monthly | `0 6 1 * *` | Financial close, monthly reviews |

**3. Idempotency by Default**
Every scheduled task should produce the same result if run twice. This means:
- Queries use relative date windows (`current_date - 1`) rather than hardcoded dates
- Destination writes use upsert patterns (update if exists, insert if not)
- Notifications include a unique deduplication key

**4. Failure Visibility**
Silent failures are worse than no automation. Every integration includes:
- Success/failure logging with timestamps
- Alerting on repeated failures (3 consecutive failures → escalate)
- A health dashboard showing last-successful-run per automation

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Choose Your First Integration
Start with the lowest-risk, highest-visibility integration. For most teams, that's **Slack + GitHub**  --  it's immediately useful, non-destructive, and easy to verify.

### Step 2: Set Up MCP Servers
Each integration guide lists the MCP servers you need. Configure them with read-only credentials wherever possible:
- GitHub: personal access token with `repo:status`, `public_repo`, and `read:org` scopes
- Gmail/Calendar: OAuth with `readonly` scopes
- Database: dedicated read-only user on a replica
- CRM: API keys with read-only access

### Step 3: Run in Dry-Run Mode
For the first week, configure automations to log their intended actions without executing them. Review the logs daily. This catches:
- Incorrect assumptions about data formats
- Queries that return unexpected results
- Edge cases (empty results, timezone issues, rate limits)

### Step 4: Enable One Automation at a Time
After dry-run validation, enable automations individually with a 48-hour observation period between each. This limits the blast radius of any misconfiguration.

### Step 5: Monitor and Tune
Track these metrics for each automation:
- Execution time (is it getting slower?)
- Success rate (are transient failures increasing?)
- Actionable vs noise ratio (are alerts useful?)
- User feedback (are people finding value or muting?)

## Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Prevention |
|---|---|
| Production database overload from reporting queries | Always use read replicas; set query timeouts |
| Rate limit exhaustion from too-frequent cron | Match cron frequency to API tier limits |
| Timezone mismatches in scheduled reports | Use UTC internally; convert at presentation layer |
| Stale credentials breaking automations silently | Health-check every automation daily; alert on auth failures |
| Alert fatigue from over-aggressive thresholds | Start with high thresholds; tighten based on feedback |
| Data drift between integrated systems | Run reconciliation queries weekly; flag discrepancies |

## Extending the Patterns

These four integrations are examples of a generalizable pattern. You can apply the same architecture to:

- **CI/CD + Communication:** Connect CI platforms (GitHub Actions, CircleCI, Jenkins) to Slack/Teams for build and deploy notifications
- **Finance + Operations:** Connect payment processors (Stripe) to accounting (QuickBooks) for automated reconciliation
- **Marketing + Sales:** Connect ad platforms (Google Ads, Meta) to CRM for closed-loop attribution
- **Support + Engineering:** Connect help desks (Zendesk, Intercom) to issue trackers for bug escalation
- **HR + Calendar:** Connect HR systems to calendar for automated onboarding scheduling

The pattern is always: **read from sources → compute/enrich/detect → write to destinations → alert on anomalies → log everything.**
