# Meta (Facebook, Instagram, Ads)

## What it unlocks
Meta Ads is usually one of the largest line items in a SaaS or ecommerce budget, and Meta's own ROAS numbers are notoriously optimistic. Connecting Meta gives CorpusIQ read access to the whole Meta family through one connection: Meta Ads (Facebook and Instagram advertising), your Facebook and Instagram pages, and the content data behind them. You do not connect Facebook, Instagram, and Meta Ads separately — one Meta connector covers all of it.

With it, CorpusIQ can pull spend, impressions, clicks, and platform-reported conversions, then compare them honestly to GA4 sessions and Shopify revenue — so you can see what Meta actually drove, not what Meta claims it drove.

## Before you connect
- A Meta Business account with access to the ad account(s) you want to read
- Admin or analyst role on those ad accounts
- About 2 minutes

## How to connect
1. In CorpusIQ, open Dashboard → Connectors and find Meta.
2. Click Connect.
3. Sign in to Facebook when the consent screen appears.
4. <!-- screenshot: Meta OAuth consent — ad account selector -->
5. Choose which ad accounts CorpusIQ may read and approve `ads_read` access.
6. You'll be returned to CorpusIQ.

You'll see Meta change from gray to green in your CorpusIQ dashboard.

## What CorpusIQ can see
Read-only access to:
- Ad accounts and their currency, status, and balance
- Campaigns, ad sets, and individual ads with creative details
- Account-level insights — impressions, clicks, spend, reach, frequency, CPM, CPC, CTR
- Campaign-level daily performance
- Breakdowns by age, gender, geography, device, platform, and placement
- Facebook and Instagram pages — page info, followers, and page-level content

All of this comes through the one Meta connection. The Meta Business account you sign in with must have access to the pages and ad accounts you want to read.

**Read-only guarantee:** CorpusIQ cannot create, edit, or pause ads, and it cannot change budgets, bidding, or targeting. It only reads. It is not an AI agent, stores no data, and no one at CorpusIQ can access your account. Full details: [Security and Read-Only Access](/hermes/security/read-only-and-security/)

CorpusIQ never creates ads, edits budgets, or pauses campaigns.

## Questions you can ask
- "How much did I spend on Meta Ads last week?"
- "Which Facebook campaigns have the best CTR?"
- "Compare my Meta-reported conversions to GA4 conversions."
- "Show me daily spend on the spring sale campaign."
- "What's my true ROAS on Meta after attribution through GA4 and Shopify?"

## Troubleshooting
- **"No ad accounts found"** — Your Facebook user must be added as a person on the ad account in Business Manager. Page-level admin isn't enough.
- **"Permissions error on insights"** — Reconnect and make sure you approved the `ads_read` permission during OAuth.
- **Spend looks different than Meta UI** — Meta defaults to a 7-day click attribution window in some places and 1-day in others. CorpusIQ pulls raw spend, which always matches Billing & Payments, not the campaign UI's attributed numbers.
