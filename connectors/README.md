# Connectors

CorpusIQ connects to your business tools through read-only MCP connectors.
Each connector requires a one-time OAuth authentication - you click Connect,
approve the permission screen, and your AI tools can query live data immediately.

**Read-only by design.** CorpusIQ is not an AI agent. It cannot write,
modify, or execute anything in your connected systems, and it does not
retain raw customer files or full connector response payloads. Data
passes through on demand and returns to your AI client as read-only
information. No one at CorpusIQ can access your accounts.
See the full guarantee: [Security and Read-Only Access](/hermes/security/read-only-and-security/)

The external-source connectors in this directory are designed for read-only retrieval and do not write back to connected vendor accounts. Separately annotated CorpusIQ control-plane tools are outside this connector directory.

## How to connect any connector

1. Open the CorpusIQ **Connectors** page
2. Click **Connect** next to the tool you want
3. A browser tab opens to the vendor's login page
4. Sign in, review the read-only permissions, click **Authorize**
5. The tab returns to CorpusIQ - the connector shows **Connected**

That's it. Your AI assistant can now query live data from that service.

Connector-specific notes (required plans, admin roles, multi-account setups) are on each individual connector page.
