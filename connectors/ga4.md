# GA4 - Google Analytics 4

## What the GA4 connector does

The GA4 connector makes your analytics answerable in plain English from any AI assistant. Connect once and ChatGPT, Claude, or Perplexity can query sessions, users, pageviews, traffic sources, conversion events, ecommerce revenue and real-time active users across any date range - and join those numbers to Google Ads spend or Shopify revenue through the same CorpusIQ endpoint. GA4 is part of the Google Workspace connector: sign in with the Google account that has access to the property and select the property to read. The connection is read-only and never modifies your Analytics data, and individual user PII is never exposed. CorpusIQ does not retain raw customer files or full connector response payloads, and operational query logs are bounded. Setup takes about two minutes.

## What it unlocks

Connect GA4 to CorpusIQ and ask plain-English questions about your website traffic, conversions, acquisition sources, and revenue - without leaving Claude or ChatGPT.
