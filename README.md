**CorpusIQ is the live-data brain you plug into ChatGPT, Claude, or any AI assistant.** Connect the tools you already use — QuickBooks, Shopify, Stripe, HubSpot, GA4, Klaviyo, Slack, and 40+ more — then ask plain-English questions and get answers grounded in your actual business data. No dashboards. No reports. No waiting on someone to pull the numbers.

> "How much did we make last month across Shopify and Stripe?" — answered in seconds.

## What makes it different

| Instead of... | CorpusIQ lets you... |
|---------------|---------------------|
| Building dashboards nobody checks | Ask questions in plain English, get real data |
| Exporting CSVs from 5 different tools | Query everything at once — cross-source, live |
| Waiting on someone to "pull the numbers" | Get answers in seconds, not days |
| Learning SQL or hiring a data team | Your AI assistant becomes your analyst |
| Static reports that are outdated by lunch | Live data, every time you ask |

---

## How it works — 3 steps

1. **Connect** — Authorize external-source retrieval through each provider's documented OAuth flow
2. **Ask** — Type a question in ChatGPT, Claude, or any MCP-compatible assistant
3. **Get answers** — Source data passes through CorpusIQ to the requesting AI client with citations; that client's conversation policy applies after receipt.

## For developers: MCP-native from day one

CorpusIQ is built on the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) — the open standard for connecting AI assistants to external tools and data.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "corpusiq": {
      "url": "https://mcp2.corpusiq.io/mcp",
      "transport": "streamable-http"
    }
  }
}
```

Your AI assistant gets 40+ live data tools instantly. No SDK. No custom integration. Just works.
