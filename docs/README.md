# CorpusIQ Documentation

CorpusIQ is a private AI acceleration layer that connects 40+ business tools to ChatGPT, Claude, and Perplexity via the Model Context Protocol (MCP). One question. Cited answers from all your tools.

CorpusIQ provides read-only external-source retrieval between authorized SaaS applications and AI assistants. Explicit CorpusIQ control-plane tools that update or remove user-declared state are separately annotated. Direct MCP requests retrieve source records live without retaining raw customer files or full connector response payloads. Operational query text, tool-call metadata, and bounded outcome summaries are retained for up to 30 days. Every response includes citations back to the source tool, so you can verify accuracy in one click.

## Key Capabilities

- **40+ native connectors**  --  Gmail, Google Drive, Slack, HubSpot, Shopify, QuickBooks, PostgreSQL, and more
- **MCP-native**  --  Designed for AI assistants that speak the Model Context Protocol
- **Operation-level permissions**  --  External-source retrieval tools are marked read-only; write-capable and CorpusIQ control-plane tools are separately named and annotated
- **Scoped data handling**  --  Direct MCP uses live retrieval; optional indexed-search features use embeddings and minimal metadata
- **SOC 2 aligned & CASA Tier 2 certified**  --  formal SOC 2 certification is not claimed; CASA was assessed by DEKRA

CorpusIQ translates AI assistant queries into read-only API calls and returns cited results. Direct MCP requests use live retrieval and do not build embeddings or file indexes. Optional indexed-search features use embeddings and minimal metadata in a per-user namespace. Local AUDIT logs record raw query text and tool parameters plus bounded result summaries; the Azure Log Analytics workspace retains those logs for 30 days.
