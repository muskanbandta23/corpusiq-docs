# HubSpot Business Intelligence  --  Connect Your CRM to AI

## Introduction

HubSpot is one of the world's most widely adopted CRM platforms, used by over 200,000 businesses to manage contacts, deals, companies, and customer relationships. But while HubSpot excels at storing and organizing data, extracting real-time business intelligence from that data often requires exporting to spreadsheets, building custom dashboards, or relying on HubSpot's built-in reporting  --  which, while capable, can't answer free-form business questions in natural language.

CorpusIQ changes that. Using the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**  --  the open standard for connecting data to AI  --  CorpusIQ enables any MCP-compatible AI assistant to query HubSpot through live retrieval. Direct MCP does not retain raw customer files or full connector response payloads; operational logs and optional indexed search follow their published lifecycles.

## How It Works

CorpusIQ's HubSpot connector creates a direct, authenticated bridge between your HubSpot instance and any AI assistant that speaks the MCP protocol  --  including ChatGPT, Claude, and custom AI applications.

**The process is three steps:**

1. **Connect**  --  Authenticate your HubSpot account through CorpusIQ's secure OAuth flow. One click, no configuration files, no API key management.

2. **Query**  --  Your AI assistant accesses your HubSpot data through CorpusIQ's MCP server. It can list contacts, search companies, retrieve deal details, and analyze pipeline metrics  --  all with natural-language questions.

3. **Analyze**  --  Get instant answers: "What's our pipeline value this quarter?" "Show me companies without recent activity." "Which deals are stuck in negotiation?" Every answer draws from live HubSpot data  --  not a stale export.

**Technical detail:** CorpusIQ's MCP implementation wraps HubSpot's REST API v1/legacy endpoints  --  contacts, companies, deals  --  into typed tool functions that AI models can discover and invoke reliably. Each function returns structured JSON that the AI can interpret, summarize, and present in natural language.

## Key Features

### 1. Live CRM Querying
No ETL, no data warehouse, no batch sync. Ask a question, get an answer from live HubSpot data. Changes made in HubSpot are immediately available to your AI.

### 2. Natural Language Pipeline Analysis
Ask "What's our deal pipeline look like?" and get a breakdown of deal stages, values, and close dates  --  formatted as a table, summary, or chart-ready data.

### 3. Cross-Source Intelligence
HubSpot is just one of 40+ connectors in CorpusIQ. Combine CRM data with QuickBooks financials, Google Analytics traffic, Stripe payments, or Slack activity for unified business intelligence.

### 4. Enterprise Security
CorpusIQ uses read-only access for direct MCP live retrieval. It does not retain raw customer files or full connector response payloads; operational logs retain query text, per-user tool-call metadata, and bounded outcome summaries for up to 30 days.

## Benefits

| Benefit | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Zero-ETL Architecture** | No data pipelines, no data warehouse costs, no synchronization lag |

## Use Cases

### Sales Leadership
**"Show me the top 10 open deals by value, ordered by expected close date."**  
Instantly see your biggest opportunities and when they're likely to close. Drill into any deal for contact details, associated companies, and activity history.

### Marketing Operations
**"List all HubSpot contacts created this month from the 'Enterprise' lifecycle stage."**  
Segment your audience live, without building lists or reports in HubSpot's UI.

### Account Management
**"Which companies haven't had a deal created in the last 90 days?"**  
Identify at-risk accounts before they churn. Cross-reference with support tickets or email activity for full context.

### Revenue Operations
**"Compare pipeline value this quarter vs. last quarter."**  
Get period-over-period comparisons in seconds  --  ask for the data in whatever format you need.

### Executive Reporting
**"Give me a summary of our CRM health: total contacts, active deals, pipeline value, and recent activity."**  
A one-question executive briefing, powered by live data.

CorpusIQ sits between your AI and HubSpot as a **protocol translation layer**. The AI doesn't need to know HubSpot's API  --  it only needs to know how to use MCP tools. CorpusIQ handles authentication, rate limiting, pagination, and error handling transparently.

## FAQ

**Q: Is my HubSpot data secure with CorpusIQ?**  
A: CorpusIQ uses read-only access for direct MCP live retrieval. It does not retain raw customer files or full connector response payloads; operational logs retain query text, per-user tool-call metadata, and bounded outcome summaries for up to 30 days.

**Q: Does this work with the free version of HubSpot?**  
A: Yes. CorpusIQ's HubSpot connector works with all HubSpot plans  --  free, starter, professional, and enterprise. The available data depends on your plan's API access, not CorpusIQ.

**Q: Can I write data back to HubSpot through CorpusIQ?**  
A: Currently, CorpusIQ's HubSpot connector is read-only. This ensures your CRM data can't be accidentally modified through AI queries. Write capabilities are on the roadmap.

**Q: How fast are the queries?**  
A: Query speed depends on your HubSpot API tier and the complexity of the request. Most queries return within 1-3 seconds. CorpusIQ optimizes for efficiency, only fetching the fields needed to answer your question.

**Q: Can I combine HubSpot with other data sources?**  
A: Absolutely. CorpusIQ's multi-source architecture lets you ask questions that span HubSpot, QuickBooks, Stripe, Google Analytics, Slack, and 40+ other connectors simultaneously. For example: "Show me deals that closed this quarter alongside their Stripe payment status."

**Q: Do I need to know HubSpot's API?**  
A: No. You ask questions in natural language. Your AI assistant handles the MCP tool selection and HubSpot API interaction through CorpusIQ.

**Q: What HubSpot objects are supported?**  
A: Contacts, companies, and deals are fully supported. Additional objects (tickets, products, line items) are being added based on user demand.

**Q: Is there a limit on how many records I can query?**  
A: CorpusIQ respects HubSpot's API rate limits and pagination. For very large datasets, the AI assistant will automatically paginate through results.

**Q: Can multiple team members use the same HubSpot connection?**  
A: Each team member authenticates individually through their own HubSpot account, inheriting their personal permissions. CorpusIQ supports team plans for shared access management.

**Q: How does this compare to HubSpot's built-in reporting?**  
A: HubSpot's reporting is excellent for predefined dashboards and standard metrics. CorpusIQ complements it by enabling ad-hoc, free-form questions that don't fit into pre-built reports  --  plus cross-source analysis across all your business tools.
