# How to Search Company Data with AI

## The Problem

Your company's data is scattered across dozens of tools: customer records in HubSpot, financials in QuickBooks, payments in Stripe, analytics in GA4, emails in Gmail, files in Google Drive. Finding specific information means logging into each tool, navigating its search interface, and piecing together answers manually. A simple question like "What did we discuss with the Acme Corp account last month?" could mean checking CRM notes, email threads, Slack channels, and support tickets.

## The Solution

CorpusIQ's MCP platform creates a unified AI search layer across all your business tools. Instead of searching each tool individually, you ask natural-language questions and the AI queries every connected source simultaneously  --  returning answers in seconds.

## What You'll Need

- CorpusIQ account with connected data sources
- An MCP-compatible AI assistant (ChatGPT, Claude, or custom client)
- Connected data sources relevant to your search (minimum: CRM + email recommended)

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Connect Your Company's Core Tools

Start with the data sources that contain the most commonly searched information:

1. **CRM (HubSpot/Salesforce):** Contacts, companies, deals, activities
2. **Email (Gmail/Outlook):** Communications, attachments, threads
3. **Communication (Slack):** Internal discussions, channels, decisions
4. **Documents (Google Drive/OneDrive/Dropbox):** Files, spreadsheets, presentations
5. **Accounting (QuickBooks):** Invoices, payments, financial records
6. **Analytics (GA4):** Website traffic, conversions, user behavior

Each connection takes under 60 seconds through CorpusIQ's OAuth flow.

### Step 2: Configure Your AI Assistant

1. Copy your MCP Server URL from the CorpusIQ dashboard
2. Add it to your AI assistant's MCP configuration
3. The AI will automatically discover all available search tools across your connected sources

### Step 3: Master the Search Patterns

AI-powered company search works differently than traditional search. Here are the most effective patterns:

**Account 360 Search:**
```
"Give me everything about Acme Corp: contacts, recent emails, open deals, 
and support tickets"
```

**Communication Search:**
```
"Find all emails and Slack messages about the Q3 budget from the finance team"
```

**Document Search:**
```
"Find the latest version of the pricing spreadsheet in our Drive"
```

**Cross-Source Investigation:**
```
"Show me customers who haven't paid their invoices and whether we've 
emailed them about it"
```

**Trend Discovery:**
```
"What were the most discussed topics in our Slack channels last month?"
```

### Step 4: Refine Your Searches

AI search improves with context. Add specificity to get better results:

| Vague Query | Better Query |
|-------------|-------------|
| "Show me Acme info" | "Show me Acme Corp's contacts, recent deals, and email history from the last 90 days" |
| "What invoices are overdue?" | "Show me overdue invoices over $1,000 sorted by days overdue" |
| "Find emails about the project" | "Find emails from Sarah to the engineering team about the Phoenix project in June" |

### Step 5: Save and Share Insights

When you find valuable information, save it:

- **Copy the AI's answer** to your notes or documents
- **Share the query** with teammates so they can run it too
- **Build a library** of effective search queries for common business questions

## Example Search Results

**Query:** "Give me the full picture on GlobalTech Inc."

**AI Response (powered by CorpusIQ):**

```

```

## CorpusIQ's Role

CorpusIQ is the engine that makes this possible. It:

1. **Unifies data access** across all your tools through a single MCP endpoint
2. **Translates natural language** into structured API queries across each source
3. **Orchestrates parallel queries**  --  searching CRM, email, accounting, and support tools simultaneously
4. **Returns structured data** that AI can format into coherent, readable answers
5. **Scoped direct-MCP retention.** CorpusIQ uses read-only access for direct MCP live retrieval. It does not retain raw customer files or full connector response payloads; operational logs retain query text, per-user tool-call metadata, and bounded outcome summaries for up to 30 days.

## FAQ

**Q: Is this like Google for my company but with AI?**  
A: Yes, but more powerful. It's a unified search across ALL your business tools, with natural language understanding and the ability to combine information from multiple sources into a single answer.

**Q: Can it search within documents and emails?**  
A: Yes. Connected email (Gmail, Outlook) and drive (Google Drive, OneDrive, Dropbox) are searchable by content, subject, sender, date, and more.

**Q: How is this different from each tool's built-in search?**  
A: Built-in search only searches one tool. CorpusIQ searches across all connected tools simultaneously and presents unified results. You don't need to know which tool has the answer.

**Q: Is my data safe during AI searches?**  
A: Yes. CorpusIQ queries live APIs with read-only access. Direct MCP does not retain raw customer files or full connector response payloads; scoped operational logs may be retained for up to 30 days. Optional indexed search has a separate embeddings and minimal-metadata lifecycle. The AI sees only the results needed for your query.

**Q: Can I search by date ranges?**  
A: Yes. Most connectors support date filtering. Ask "Show me deals from Q2 2026" or "Find emails from last week about the budget."

**Q: What if the search returns too many results?**  
A: Refine your query with more specifics  --  add date ranges, dollar amounts, people, or departments. The AI helps you narrow results interactively.

**Q: Can non-technical team members use this?**  
A: Absolutely. If you can type a question, you can search. No SQL, no search syntax, no training required.

**Q: Does this work on mobile?**  
A: Yes. Any AI assistant with MCP support on mobile can search your company data.
