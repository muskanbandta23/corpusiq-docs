# The MCP Specification Goes GA on July 28. Here Is What Operators Should Know.

The Model Context Protocol hits general availability on July 28, 2026. For the developers building MCP servers, this is a version bump and a spec freeze. For operators running businesses, it is something bigger.

It means the protocol that lets AI talk to your tools is no longer experimental.

## What changes for operators

Before GA, adopting MCP meant betting on a pre-release specification. Every MCP server you connected was built against a moving target. Breaking changes happened. Endpoints shifted. Things broke between releases.

After July 28, the spec is stable. The transport layer is defined. The auth framework is settled. MCP servers built against the GA spec will work tomorrow the way they work today.

This is the moment enterprise adoption unlocks. Compliance teams can audit a stable specification. Security teams can review a fixed auth model. Procurement can evaluate MCP platforms against a published standard instead of a draft proposal.

## What does not change

Your AI still cannot write to your tools. Read-only access remains the default. CorpusIQ has never allowed agents to create Stripe charges, modify QuickBooks invoices, or adjust Shopify orders. The GA spec reinforces this boundary, it does not remove it.

Source systems remain authoritative. MCP is a protocol, not a warehouse. Direct MCP does not retain raw customer files or full connector response payloads; scoped operational logs may persist for up to 30 days. Your AI gets live answers from your live tools.

## The practical effect

If you have been waiting to connect your business tools to AI until the spec stabilized, the wait ends on July 28.

The question stops being "is MCP ready?" and becomes "which MCP platform connects to my actual tools?"

That is the question we built CorpusIQ to answer.
