# How to Connect QuickBooks to Claude with CorpusIQ MCP

Finance teams spend countless hours pulling reports from QuickBooks, reformatting them in Excel, and building presentations to answer questions that executives ask in seconds. Connecting QuickBooks to Claude via CorpusIQ's MCP platform eliminates that manual work. Ask Claude "What was our gross margin last quarter?", "Show me our top 5 overdue invoices", or "What's our cash position?" and receive accurate, real-time answers backed by your live QuickBooks data.

The integration works through the Model Context Protocol (MCP), an open standard that CorpusIQ implements to give Claude secure, read-only access to QuickBooks. Setup takes under five minutes. No API keys. No code. No financial analyst required.

### Why Connect QuickBooks to Claude?

QuickBooks contains your company's financial truth  --  profit and loss, balance sheet, accounts receivable and payable, invoices, bills, and cash flow. But accessing that data typically means logging into QuickBooks, navigating reports, exporting data, and manually interpreting the numbers. Claude changes the paradigm by becoming the interface to your financial data.

**Key benefits of connecting QuickBooks to Claude:**

- **Instant financial answers.** Ask "What was our net income for Q1?" and Claude returns the number with context  --  no report building required.
- **Executive-ready summaries.** Claude can synthesize complex financial data into digestible summaries, trend analyses, and recommendations.
- **AR/AP visibility.** Ask "Which customers owe us more than $5,000?" or "What bills are due next week?" without digging through QuickBooks screens.
- **Cross-source financial intelligence.** Combine QuickBooks data with Shopify revenue, Stripe payments, or Salesforce pipeline for a complete financial picture.
- **Cash flow at your fingertips.** Claude can analyze your balance sheet, AR aging, and AP aging together to give you an instant cash position assessment.
- **Operation-level safety.** QuickBooks retrieval tools are marked read-only; write-capable tools, when present, are separately named and annotated.

### How It Works

The CorpusIQ MCP architecture for QuickBooks follows the same secure pattern as all integrations:

1. **You connect QuickBooks once** via OAuth to Intuit. CorpusIQ requests read-only access to your company's financial data  --  P&L, balance sheet, invoices, customers, vendors, and reports.
2. **Claude interprets your question** when you ask a financial query  --  "What's our gross profit margin trend over the last 6 months?"
3. **CorpusIQ translates** your question into the appropriate QuickBooks API calls and executes them with your stored credentials.
4. **Claude presents** the results in natural language, with calculated metrics, trend observations, and actionable context.

Each question requests current QuickBooks data. Freshness follows QuickBooks and CorpusIQ cache behavior; verify time-sensitive values against cited records.

### Setup Steps

1. **Navigate to Connectors** in your CorpusIQ dashboard.
2. **Select QuickBooks** from the integration catalog.
3. **Click "Connect QuickBooks"**  --  you'll be directed to Intuit's OAuth consent screen.
4. **Authorize read-only access.** Review the scopes (Company Info, Customers, Invoices, Accounts, Reports, Vendors) and approve.
5. **Return to CorpusIQ.** Your QuickBooks data is now queryable through Claude.

That's it. The entire process takes under five minutes and requires only QuickBooks admin credentials.

### Example Claude Queries After Connecting QuickBooks

Once connected, Claude becomes your always-available financial analyst:

**Profitability Analysis:**
- "Show me our P&L for Q2 with month-over-month comparisons."
- "What's our gross margin by product or service line?"
- "How has our operating expense ratio changed over the last year?"
- "What's our net profit margin trend for the last 8 quarters?"

**Accounts Receivable:**
- "Which customers have overdue invoices, sorted by amount?"
- "What's our total AR balance and how is it aging?"
- "Show me the top 10 customers by outstanding balance."
- "Which invoices are more than 60 days past due?"

**Accounts Payable:**
- "What bills are due in the next 7 days?"
- "Show me our AP aging summary."
- "How much do we owe to each vendor?"

**Cash Flow Intelligence:**
- "Based on our AR, AP, and bank balances, what's our projected cash position in 30 days?"
- "Show me our cash inflow vs. outflow trend by month."
- "What were our largest expenses last month?"

**Cross-Source Financial Intelligence:**
- "Compare revenue in QuickBooks to revenue in Shopify  --  are they reconciled?" (requires Shopify connected)
- "Match Stripe payouts to QuickBooks deposits  --  are there discrepancies?" (requires Stripe connected)
- "Show me Salesforce pipeline vs. QuickBooks actuals by quarter." (requires Salesforce connected)

### Security and Compliance

Financial data is among the most sensitive information in any organization. CorpusIQ's QuickBooks integration is built with that sensitivity in mind:

- **Read-only OAuth 2.0.** Claude can query financial data but can never create journal entries, modify invoices, or delete transactions.
- **Documented controls.** CorpusIQ maintains a SOC 2 aligned posture and is CASA Tier 2 certified by DEKRA; formal SOC 2 certification is not claimed.
- **Scoped direct-MCP retention.** QuickBooks retrieval tools are marked read-only. It does not retain raw customer files or full connector response payloads; operational logs retain query text, per-user tool-call metadata, and bounded outcome summaries for up to 30 days.
- **Disconnect behavior.** CorpusIQ disconnect commits inactive connection state and requires reauthorization; provider authorization remains governed by Intuit.
- **Audit trail.** All queries through CorpusIQ are logged, giving your compliance team visibility into who asked what and when.

### Comparison: MCP vs. Direct QuickBooks API

| Aspect | CorpusIQ MCP | Direct QuickBooks API |
|---|---|---|
| Setup | 5-minute OAuth flow | Days to weeks (developer, Intuit Developer account, app approval) |
| Natural language | Yes  --  plain English queries | No  --  requires OData or REST API calls |
| Cross-source analysis | Built-in (QuickBooks + Shopify + Stripe + Salesforce) | Requires custom data warehouse |
| Maintenance | Zero  --  API versioning handled | Ongoing  --  Intuit updates, deprecation management |
| Security | Read-only OAuth, encrypted tokens | Must implement your own security |
| Non-technical access | Any team member can query | Only developers or analysts with API skills |
