# ChatGPT for HubSpot: Your AI-Powered CRM Command Center

HubSpot is the nerve center of your sales and marketing operations  --  deals, contacts, companies, campaigns, and customer communications all flow through it. But extracting actionable intelligence from HubSpot has traditionally meant navigating complex report builders, building custom dashboards, or exporting data for spreadsheet analysis. **CorpusIQ connects ChatGPT directly to your HubSpot CRM through the Model Context Protocol (MCP),** transforming CRM data access from a technical skill into a conversational capability.

Instead of asking your sales ops team to build a pipeline report, you ask ChatGPT: "What deals are at risk of slipping this quarter?" Instead of exporting contact lists for segmentation, you ask: "Which leads from our last trade show haven't been contacted yet?" Your CRM data becomes accessible to everyone who needs it  --  in plain English, in real time, with AI-powered analysis.

## How It Works

CorpusIQ's MCP platform creates a secure, real-time bridge between ChatGPT and your HubSpot portal:

1. **Connect HubSpot**  --  Authenticate your HubSpot account through CorpusIQ's OAuth 2.0 flow. The platform establishes a read-only connection to your CRM data: contacts, companies, deals, pipelines, and engagement data.

2. **Structured CRM Access**  --  CorpusIQ exposes HubSpot as a set of structured tools: contact searches, deal lookups, company queries, pipeline analytics, and engagement tracking. ChatGPT automatically selects the right tool for each question.

3. **Natural Language Interaction**  --  Ask questions conversationally: "What's our pipeline coverage for Q3?" or "Which sales rep closed the most revenue last month?" ChatGPT interprets your intent, queries HubSpot, and returns actionable answers.

4. **Iterative Drill-Down**  --  Start broad, get specific: "Show me our pipeline" → "Filter to deals over $50K" → "Which ones haven't had activity in 14 days?" → "Draft an email to each deal owner asking for an update."

## Key Benefits

### Real-Time Pipeline Visibility
Stop building pipeline reports manually. Ask "What's our pipeline by stage and rep?" or "Which deals are stuck in the negotiation stage for more than 30 days?" and get instant answers. Pipeline reviews that used to require hours of preparation now happen conversationally during the meeting itself.

### Sales Team Performance Intelligence
Understand individual and team performance without building reports: "Rank reps by closed revenue this quarter" or "Compare each rep's quota attainment, average deal size, and win rate." Identify top performers to learn from and struggling reps to coach.

### Contact and Company Insights
HubSpot holds rich data about your contacts and companies, but extracting insights requires knowing how to build lists and reports. ChatGPT democratizes this: "Show me all contacts from the healthcare industry with deals over $10K who haven't been emailed in 30 days"  --  complex segmentation in one sentence.

### Deal Risk Detection
Spot problems before they become losses: "Identify deals that haven't advanced stages in 3+ weeks" or "Flag deals where the contact hasn't responded to the last 2 emails." AI-powered risk detection surfaces issues that manual pipeline reviews miss.

### Campaign-Performance Connection
When combined with CorpusIQ's multi-source capabilities, connect HubSpot campaign data to actual revenue: "Which marketing campaigns generated the most closed-won revenue this quarter?" True campaign attribution requires connecting marketing activity to sales outcomes.

## Use Cases

### Weekly Pipeline Review
A sales manager starts their weekly review: "Pipeline review  --  deals by stage and rep, deals at risk (no activity in 14+ days), deals closing this week, and quarter-to-date closed revenue vs. target." ChatGPT pulls live HubSpot data and presents the complete review.

### Territory Planning
A VP of Sales asks: "Analyze our deal distribution by geography  --  which territories have the strongest pipeline, which are underperforming relative to quota, and where should we add headcount based on pipeline-to-rep ratio?"

### Lead Follow-Up Audit
A sales operations manager asks: "Show me all leads created in the last 30 days that haven't been contacted yet. Group by lead source and age, and flag any over 7 days old." Instant identification of leads falling through the cracks.

### Win-Loss Analysis
A sales enablement leader asks: "Analyze closed-lost deals from the last two quarters  --  what's the most common loss reason, at what stage do most deals fall out, and is there a correlation between deal size and win rate?"

### Customer Health Check
An account manager asks: "For our top 50 customers by revenue, when was their last deal closed? Are there any without an open deal or recent activity? Flag accounts that may need proactive engagement."

### Board Reporting
A CEO asks: "Board metrics  --  Q3 pipeline generated, closed-won revenue, average deal size, win rate, sales cycle length, and pipeline coverage ratio. Compare all metrics to Q3 last year and to this year's plan."

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is my HubSpot data secure?
Yes. CorpusIQ uses read-only access for direct MCP live retrieval. It does not retain raw customer files or full connector response payloads; operational logs retain query text, per-user tool-call metadata, and bounded outcome summaries for up to 30 days.

### Can ChatGPT modify my HubSpot data?
No. The connection is read-only. ChatGPT can analyze your pipeline, identify risks, and recommend actions  --  but it cannot create deals, modify contacts, update stages, or change any CRM data. Your team retains full control.

### What HubSpot data can ChatGPT access?
ChatGPT can access contacts, companies, deals, pipelines, and engagement data. Through CorpusIQ's multi-source capabilities (Pro/Enterprise), you can also connect HubSpot marketing data (campaigns, emails, forms) for closed-loop marketing-to-sales analytics.

### Which HubSpot hubs are supported?
CorpusIQ supports Sales Hub, Marketing Hub, and Service Hub data. The specific tools available depend on your HubSpot subscription level. Contact records, companies, and deals are available across all tiers that include CRM access.

### How is this different from HubSpot's built-in reporting?
HubSpot's report builder requires you to know what you're looking for and how to configure reports. ChatGPT lets you ask open-ended questions: "Why did our win rate drop this quarter?"  --  the AI investigates multiple potential causes (deal stage bottlenecks, competitive losses, rep performance) and presents findings. It's investigative analytics, not just pre-built reports.

### Can I use this for sales coaching?
Yes. Managers can ask: "Analyze [rep name]'s pipeline  --  deal velocity by stage, win rate by deal size, common loss reasons, and activity patterns. What specific improvements would most impact their quota attainment?" AI-powered coaching insights based on actual CRM data.

### Does this work with custom HubSpot properties?
Yes. ChatGPT discovers your custom properties dynamically. If you have custom deal fields, contact properties, or company attributes, the AI can filter, group, and analyze by them just like standard fields.

### Can I track deals across multiple pipelines?
Yes. If your HubSpot has multiple pipelines (e.g., new business, renewal, partner), ChatGPT can analyze each independently or provide consolidated views. Specify the pipeline in your query: "Show me the renewal pipeline for Q4."

### How does billing work?
CorpusIQ bills based on tool calls to HubSpot's API. Typical queries use 1-3 tool calls. Most plans support hundreds of queries per month. You also need a ChatGPT Plus, Team, or Enterprise subscription.

### Can my entire sales team use this?
Yes. Through CorpusIQ's team accounts, multiple users can connect to the same HubSpot portal. Role-based access controls on Business and Enterprise plans ensure each user sees only the data appropriate for their role.
