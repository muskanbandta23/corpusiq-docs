# How to Connect Asana to ChatGPT with CorpusIQ MCP

Your **Asana** account holds critical business data  --  but accessing insights usually means logging in, navigating dashboards, and running manual reports. **Connecting Asana to ChatGPT through CorpusIQ MCP** eliminates all that friction. Once connected via a secure OAuth flow, ChatGPT can query your live Asana data directly  --  you ask questions in plain English, and get cited answers drawn from your actual account, not outdated exports or screenshots.

Once connected, ChatGPT can query your live Asana data  --  projects, tasks, sections, assignees, due dates, custom fields, and milestones. You ask questions in plain English and get cited answers from your actual Asana workspace in real time.

This page covers the connection architecture, what you can ask, team collaboration use cases, security, and how MCP compares to direct Asana API integration.

## FAQ: Common Questions

<details>
<summary><strong>What project questions can I ask ChatGPT about Asana?</strong></summary>

Task questions: "What tasks are assigned to me this week?", "Show me all overdue tasks across my projects", "Which tasks are blocked and waiting on someone else?" Project questions: "What's the completion percentage for Project X?", "Show me all active projects and their status", "Which projects are behind schedule?" Assignee questions: "Who has the most open tasks?", "Show me tasks by team member for this sprint." Milestone questions: "What milestones are coming up this month?", "Which milestones have been missed?" Custom field questions: "Show me all high-priority tasks across all projects", "Which tasks are tagged 'Client Review'?"
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How does the connection work?</strong></summary>

CorpusIQ connects to your Asana account via OAuth 2.0. You authorize read-only access to your workspace, then connect the CorpusIQ MCP server to ChatGPT. ChatGPT discovers the available Asana tools  --  project listing, task search, section retrieval, and metadata access  --  and calls them when you ask a question. The MCP server handles the Asana REST API, including pagination, rate limiting, and field expansion.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Is the connection read-only?</strong></summary>

Yes. CorpusIQ requests read-only external-source retrieval scopes from Asana. ChatGPT can see projects, tasks, sections, assignees, and custom fields. It cannot create tasks, reassign work, change due dates, modify projects, or alter anything in your Asana workspace. The read-only guarantee is enforced at both the OAuth permission and MCP tool layers.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What Asana data can ChatGPT access?</strong></summary>

Projects with status, owner, and timeline information. Tasks with assignee, due date, status, section, custom fields, and dependencies. Sections within projects. Workspace and organization metadata. All accessed through read-only operations  --  ChatGPT reads your project data, never writes to it.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can ChatGPT combine Asana data with data from other tools?</strong></summary>

Absolutely. "Show me Asana tasks for projects that correspond to HubSpot deals closing this month" combines project management with CRM. "Which overdue Asana tasks are for clients who emailed us this week in Gmail?" combines tasks with email. "Show me Asana project completion rates vs. our sprint velocity in Jira" compares project management across platforms. Cross-source context is the defining advantage of [MCP platforms like CorpusIQ](benefits-of-mcp-for-business.md).
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How is this different from Asana's built-in reporting?</strong></summary>

Asana's reporting features  --  Portfolios, Goals, Dashboards, Universal Reporting  --  are powerful for structured, recurring reports. But they require configuration and don't answer ad-hoc questions: "Show me all tasks that were due last week, are still incomplete, and are assigned to designers who also have high-priority tasks due this week." That's a ChatGPT question, and it would require building and combining multiple Asana reports to replicate.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I query across multiple Asana projects and teams?</strong></summary>

Yes. "Show me all open tasks across the Engineering portfolio." "What's the workload distribution across the Design and Content teams this week?" "Which projects across the entire organization have the most overdue tasks?" Cross-project and cross-team queries work naturally through ChatGPT.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What about Asana's custom fields?</strong></summary>

Custom fields are fully supported. If you use custom fields for priority, effort estimation, sprint assignment, or client name, ChatGPT can filter and group by these fields. "Show me all tasks where the custom field 'Story Points' is greater than 8" works as naturally as asking about built-in fields.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How does this handle task dependencies?</strong></summary>

Task dependency information (blocked by, blocking, dependent on) is accessible. "Which tasks are blocked and what's blocking them?" "Show me tasks that are blocking other high-priority work." Dependency chains that would require clicking through multiple task views are summarized in one response.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I get a daily or weekly summary?</strong></summary>

Yes. "Give me a summary of what my team accomplished this week, what's overdue, and what's due next week." "What's the status of all projects in the Marketing portfolio?" These summaries replace manually compiling status from multiple Asana views and projects.
</details>

## How It Works

1. **Connect Asana to CorpusIQ.** Dashboard → Connections → Asana → sign into Asana → select workspace → authorize read-only access. Takes 2 minutes.

2. **Connect CorpusIQ to ChatGPT.** Add the CorpusIQ MCP server. ChatGPT discovers tools for querying projects, tasks, sections, and metadata across your Asana workspace.

3. **Ask project questions.** ChatGPT maps your question to the appropriate Asana API calls, retrieves data through the MCP server, and returns cited answers.

4. **Drill down conversationally.** "Now show me just the ones assigned to the design team" or "Which of those are the highest priority?"  --  follow-ups maintain context.

No Asana login. No project navigation. No manual status compilation.

## Benefits

**Instant project visibility.** "What's the status of the Q3 Website Redesign project?" replaces navigating to the project, scrolling through sections, and mentally summarizing progress. One question, one complete answer.

**Automated status reporting.** Instead of manually compiling weekly status from multiple Asana projects, ask ChatGPT: "Summarize this week's progress across all active projects  --  tasks completed, tasks in progress, blockers, and milestones achieved." Status reporting becomes a conversation, not a manual data gathering exercise.

**Resource and workload insights.** "Who has more than 10 open tasks?" "Show me workload distribution across the team this sprint." "Which team members have availability based on their current task load?" Resource planning insights without building custom Asana dashboards.

**Cross-project risk identification.** "Which projects across the organization have the most overdue tasks?" "Show me all high-priority tasks that are past their due date." Risk identification that spans your entire Asana workspace  --  not limited to a single project view.

**Connected project context.** "Show me Asana tasks for the HubSpot deals in the negotiation stage" or "Which project tasks are related to Shopify products with low inventory?" Project management becomes connected to your CRM, ecommerce, and communication tools  --  not isolated in Asana.

## Use Cases

### Daily Standup and Sprint Tracking

"Give me today's standup summary  --  what moved yesterday, what's planned for today, blockers." "How many sprint tasks are complete vs. remaining?" "Show me tasks that were added mid-sprint." Sprint management becomes conversational.

### Project Portfolio Management

"Show me the health dashboard for our active projects  --  completion percentages, overdue tasks, upcoming milestones." "Which projects are at risk of missing their deadlines?" Portfolio-level visibility without navigating between multiple projects.

### Team Capacity Planning

"Show me assigned tasks per team member for the next two weeks." "Who has capacity for a new project based on current task load?" "Which team has the most overdue work?" Capacity planning insights from live task data.

### Client Project Reporting

"What's the status of Client X's project? Tasks completed, remaining, and upcoming milestones." "Show me all tasks tagged for Client X across all projects." Client reporting becomes one question instead of compiling from multiple sources.

### Cross-Source Project Intelligence

"Show me all Asana tasks for customers with open HubSpot opportunities." "Which project tasks correspond to products with declining Shopify sales?" "Are there overdue design tasks for the email campaigns Klaviyo is sending this week?" Project context enriched by business data from every connected tool.

## Security: Read-Only by Design

The Asana integration is read-only at every layer:

- **OAuth 2.0** with read-only scopes. No write, create, update, or delete permissions are requested.
- **Workspace Permission Respect.** ChatGPT can only access projects and tasks within workspaces the authenticated user has access to.
- **Scoped direct-MCP retention.** CorpusIQ uses read-only access for direct MCP live retrieval. It does not retain raw customer files or full connector response payloads; operational logs retain query text, per-user tool-call metadata, and bounded outcome summaries for up to 30 days.
- **TLS 1.3 Encryption.** All data in transit is encrypted.

For teams handling sensitive project data, Asana remains the authoritative source. CorpusIQ retrieves permitted project records through direct MCP; the retention classes and lifecycles described above still apply.

## Comparison: MCP vs. Direct Asana API Integration

| Aspect | Direct API Integration | CorpusIQ MCP |
|--------|----------------------|--------------|
| **Setup** | Asana API client, OAuth, pagination, rate limiting | 2-minute OAuth authorization |
| **Query interface** | REST endpoints with JSON parameters | Natural language |
| **Multi-project queries** | Multiple API calls with manual aggregation | One question across all projects |
| **Custom fields** | Must handle field metadata and value parsing manually | Automatic  --  reference fields by name |
| **Cross-source** | Asana-only | Combine with CRM, email, ecommerce, other PM tools |
| **Pagination** | Must implement offset-based pagination and rate limit backoff | Handled automatically |
| **Maintenance** | API deprecation schedule, field schema changes | CorpusIQ handles all updates |

Direct API integration is right for building custom Asana apps, workflow automations, and deep platform integrations. For project visibility, status reporting, and work management Q&A, MCP eliminates the development effort and ongoing maintenance.
