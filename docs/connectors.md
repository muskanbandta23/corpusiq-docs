# CorpusIQ Connectors - 40+ Business Tools, One MCP Endpoint

Connect QuickBooks, Shopify, Stripe, HubSpot, GA4, and 40+ business tools to ChatGPT, Claude, and Perplexity through read-only direct MCP live retrieval. CorpusIQ does not retain raw customer files or full connector response payloads; operational logs retain query text, per-user tool-call metadata, and bounded outcome summaries for up to 30 days.

# Connectors

CorpusIQ integrates with 40+ business tools through source-specific authorization. Each connector maps to a SaaS application or database, and each published operation declares whether it is read-only or write-capable.
