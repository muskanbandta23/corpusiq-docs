# How to Connect Monday.com to ChatGPT with CorpusIQ MCP

Your **Monday.com** account holds critical business data  --  but accessing insights usually means logging in, navigating dashboards, and running manual reports. **Connecting Monday.com to ChatGPT through CorpusIQ MCP** eliminates all that friction. Once connected via a secure OAuth flow, ChatGPT can query your live Monday.com data directly  --  you ask questions in plain English, and get cited answers drawn from your actual account, not outdated exports or screenshots.

Once connected, ChatGPT can query your live Monday.com data  --  workspaces, boards, groups, items (tasks), statuses, owners, and due dates. You ask questions in plain English and get answers from your actual boards in real time.

This page covers the connection architecture, what you can ask, team productivity use cases, security, and how MCP compares to direct Monday.com API integration.

## FAQ: Common Questions

<details>
<summary><strong>What project management questions can I ask ChatGPT about Monday.com?</strong></summary>

Board questions: "What boards do I have access to?", "Show me all items on the Marketing Sprint board." Task questions: "What tasks are assigned to me this week?", "Show me overdue tasks across all boards." Status questions: "How many tasks are in the 'In Progress' stage?", "Which tasks have been in 'Review' for over a week?" Owner questions: "Who has the most open tasks?", "Show me tasks by assignee." Date questions: "What's due this week across all boards?", "Which tasks are past their due date?"
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How does the connection work?</strong></summary>

CorpusIQ connects to your Monday.com account via OAuth 2.0. You authorize read-only access, then connect the CorpusIQ MCP server to ChatGPT. ChatGPT discovers the available Monday.com tools  --  workspace listing, board listing, item retrieval, and column value inspection  --  and calls them when you ask a question. The MCP server handles the Monday.com GraphQL API, including pagination and column type mapping.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Is the connection read-only?</strong></summary>

Yes. CorpusIQ requests read-only external-source retrieval scopes from Monday.com. ChatGPT can see boards, items, statuses, owners, and due dates. It cannot create items, update statuses, reassign tasks, or modify anything in your Monday.com account. The advertised Monday.com retrieval tools are marked read-only; write-capable tools, when available, are separately named and annotated.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What Monday.com data can ChatGPT access?</strong></summary>

Workspaces and their metadata. Boards with columns, groups, and structure. Items (tasks/pulses) with column values including status, owner, due date, text, numbers, and dropdown values. The specific columns accessible depend on each board's schema  --  your custom columns are included.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can ChatGPT combine Monday.com data with other tools?</strong></summary>

Yes. "Show me all Monday.com tasks for HubSpot deals closing this month" combines work management with CRM data. "Which overdue Monday.com tasks are associated with customers who have open support emails in Gmail?" spans work management, CRM, and email. Cross-source context is the hallmark of [MCP platforms like CorpusIQ](benefits-of-mcp-for-business.md).
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How is this different from Monday.com's built-in dashboards?</strong></summary>

Monday.com's dashboards are pre-configured views with specific widgets. They're excellent for recurring reporting. But they can't answer ad-hoc questions: "Show me tasks that were due last week, are still in progress, and are assigned to people on the engineering team who also have open tasks on the QA board." That's a ChatGPT question  --  and it would require building a custom dashboard with multiple filters to replicate.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I query across multiple boards?</strong></summary>

Yes. "Show me all items across all boards assigned to me with a status that's not 'Done'" queries multiple boards simultaneously. "Compare task completion rates across the Engineering and Marketing boards this month" spans boards for comparative analysis.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What about board-level permissions?</strong></summary>

CorpusIQ respects Monday.com's board permissions. If you can't see a board in Monday.com, ChatGPT can't see it either. The MCP layer reflects the permission model of the authenticated user.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How does this handle custom columns and complex board schemas?</strong></summary>

Monday.com boards can have complex column configurations  --  status columns, people columns, date columns, formula columns, dependency columns. CorpusIQ's MCP layer maps these into readable formats. Custom columns are accessible by name  --  just reference them in your question. The MCP server handles the column type detection and value formatting.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I use this for daily standup summaries?</strong></summary>

Yes. "Give me a standup summary  --  tasks completed yesterday, tasks planned for today, and any blockers across my boards." One question replaces manually compiling status from multiple Monday.com boards before standup.
</details>

## How It Works

1. **Connect Monday.com to CorpusIQ.** Dashboard → Connections → Monday.com → sign into Monday.com → authorize read-only access. Takes 2 minutes.

2. **Connect CorpusIQ to ChatGPT.** Add the CorpusIQ MCP server. ChatGPT discovers tools for listing workspaces, boards, and items with their column values.

3. **Ask work management questions.** ChatGPT maps your question to the appropriate board and item queries, retrieves the data through the MCP server, and returns cited answers.

4. **Iterate with follow-ups.** "Now show me just the overdue ones" or "Break that down by assignee"  --  the conversation builds on previous results.

No Monday.com login required. No board navigation. No manual status compilation.

## Benefits

**Instant project visibility.** "What's the status of Project X?" replaces navigating to the right board, finding the right group, and mentally compiling status from individual items. One question, one comprehensive answer.

**Cross-board insights.** "Which projects across all boards are at risk?" queries every board you have access to and identifies items that are overdue or stalled. This cross-board visibility is difficult to achieve within Monday.com's interface.

**Automated status reporting.** Weekly status update compiled manually from Monday.com boards? "Summarize this week's progress across all active boards  --  items completed, items in progress, and blockers." Your status report becomes a ChatGPT conversation.

**Team workload visibility.** "Who has the most open tasks?" "Show me tasks per assignee across active boards." "Which team members have tasks due this week?" Workload balancing insights without building Monday.com dashboards.

**Contextual work management.** "Show me Monday.com tasks related to the HubSpot deal with Acme Corp" or "Which tasks are for customers with open support tickets?" Work management becomes connected to your CRM, support, and communication tools  --  not siloed in Monday.com alone.

## Use Cases

### Daily Standup Preparation

"Give me a standup summary for my boards  --  what moved yesterday, what's planned today, what's blocked." Arrive at standup with a complete status picture without clicking through boards.

### Sprint and Project Tracking

"What's the completion percentage for the current sprint?" "How many sprint items are still in 'To Do'?" "Which items were added to the sprint after it started?" Sprint tracking questions become conversational.

### Resource and Workload Management

"Who has more than 5 open tasks across all active boards?" "Show me workload by assignee this week." "Which tasks are unassigned?" Resource allocation insights without manual compilation.

### Executive Status Reporting

"Summarize project status across the organization  --  active projects, completion rates, blocked items." Executive stakeholders get project visibility without Monday.com accounts or dashboard training.

### Cross-Source Project Context

"Show me all tasks for customers with open HubSpot deals." "Which project tasks are related to products with low Shopify inventory?" "Are there any tasks for accounts with overdue QuickBooks invoices?" Project management connects to the rest of your business data.

## Security: Read-Only by Design

The Monday.com integration is read-only at every layer:

- **OAuth 2.0** with read-only scopes. No write, create, update, or delete permissions.
- **Permission-Respecting.** ChatGPT can only see boards and items that the authenticated user has access to in Monday.com.
- **Scoped direct-MCP retention.** CorpusIQ uses read-only access for direct MCP live retrieval. It does not retain raw customer files or full connector response payloads; operational logs retain query text, per-user tool-call metadata, and bounded outcome summaries for up to 30 days.
- **TLS 1.3 Encryption.** All data in transit is encrypted.

For organizations with sensitive project data, Monday.com remains the authoritative source. CorpusIQ retrieves permitted project data through direct MCP; the retention classes and lifecycles described above still apply.

## Comparison: MCP vs. Direct Monday.com API Integration

| Aspect | Direct API Integration | CorpusIQ MCP |
|--------|----------------------|--------------|
| **Setup** | GraphQL client, OAuth, schema discovery, query building | 2-minute OAuth authorization |
| **Query interface** | GraphQL queries with column ID references | Natural language |
| **Column mapping** | Must map column IDs to human-readable names | Automatic  --  reference columns by name |
| **Multi-board queries** | Build multiple queries with merge logic | One question across all boards |
| **Cross-source** | Monday.com-only | Combine with CRM, email, ecommerce |
| **Pagination** | Must implement cursor-based pagination | Handled automatically |
| **Maintenance** | API version updates, schema changes | CorpusIQ handles updates |

Direct API integration is appropriate for building custom Monday.com apps, automations, and deep platform integrations. For work management visibility, status reporting, and project Q&A, MCP removes the development burden entirely.
