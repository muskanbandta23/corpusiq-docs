# MCP for Ecommerce: How to Connect Your Business Data to AI

**Ecommerce teams need fast, accurate answers from their business data**  --  but traditional BI tools and manual reporting create bottlenecks that slow decision-making. The Model Context Protocol (MCP) gives ecommerce professionals direct AI-powered access to live data from QuickBooks, Salesforce, HubSpot, Shopify, and 25+ other platforms through natural language queries. No more waiting on data teams for reports  --  just connect your tools and ask questions in plain English.

## The Multi-Channel Data Challenge

A modern ecommerce business typically operates across:
- **Direct-to-consumer store** (Shopify, WooCommerce, Magento)
- **Marketplaces** (Amazon, eBay, Etsy, Walmart)
- **Advertising platforms** (Google Ads, Meta Ads, TikTok Ads)
- **Email/SMS marketing** (Klaviyo, Mailchimp, Postscript)
- **Analytics** (Google Analytics, Triple Whale, Northbeam)
- **Operations** (ShipStation, inventory management systems)
- **Financial** (QuickBooks, Stripe)

Each platform provides its own dashboard with its own metrics, its own date ranges, and its own attribution model. The result is a fragmented view where you can see pieces of the business but never the whole picture.

MCP solves this by connecting all of these platforms and letting you ask questions that span them. "Which marketing channel drove the most profitable orders this month?" queries your ad platforms and your order data simultaneously, correlating spend with revenue at the channel level.

## Shopify Integration

CorpusIQ's Shopify connector provides comprehensive access to store data:

**Order analytics.** Query orders by status, date range, product, customer, or any combination. "Show me all unfulfilled orders from the last 48 hours" or "what's our average order value by product category?"

**Product performance.** Track sales by product, variant, collection, or vendor. "Which products have the highest return rate?" or "what products should I reorder based on sales velocity?"

**Customer intelligence.** Analyze customer behavior  --  lifetime value, purchase frequency, cohort retention. "Who are our top 20 customers by LTV and what did they buy?"

**Inventory management.** Monitor stock levels, identify low-stock products, and track inventory turnover. "Which products are at risk of stockout in the next two weeks based on recent sales velocity?"

**Discount and promotion analysis.** "How did the 20% off sale impact revenue and margin compared to the previous week?"

## Amazon Seller Integration

CorpusIQ's Amazon Seller connector brings marketplace data into the unified view:

**Sales metrics.** Track units sold, revenue, and order counts by time period. "Compare Amazon sales to Shopify sales this month  --  which channel grew faster?"

**Inventory status.** Monitor FBA inventory levels, inbound shipments, and stock health. "Which FBA products need restocking and what's the lead time?"

**Order management.** View orders by status, fulfillment channel, and date. "Show me all Amazon orders from the last 24 hours that haven't shipped yet."

**Financial reconciliation.** Match Amazon settlement reports against your accounting system. "Reconcile this month's Amazon payouts with QuickBooks deposits."

**Listing performance.** Track buy box percentage, customer metrics, and account health. "Which listings have lost the buy box in the last week?"

## Cross-Channel Analytics

The real power of MCP for ecommerce is cross-channel analysis:

**Channel comparison.** "Compare revenue, margin, and customer acquisition cost across Shopify, Amazon, and eBay for Q2." One query pulls data from three platforms and presents a side-by-side comparison.

**Marketing attribution.** "Which ad campaigns generated the highest revenue across all sales channels?" Connect ad platform data to order data for true multi-touch attribution.

**Inventory across channels.** "What's our total inventory position for each SKU, including units at Amazon FBA, our warehouse, and in transit?" Unified inventory visibility.

**Customer cross-channel behavior.** "Which customers buy on both our Shopify store and Amazon?" Identify your most engaged customers regardless of channel.

**Profitability by channel.** "What's the true margin by sales channel after accounting for marketplace fees, shipping costs, and advertising spend?" Connect order data with expense data for accurate profitability analysis.

## Operational Intelligence

Beyond sales and marketing, MCP supports operational decision-making:

**Fulfillment monitoring.** "How many orders are past their promised ship date?" Identify fulfillment bottlenecks before they impact customer satisfaction.

**Return analysis.** "What's our return rate by product and what are the most common return reasons?" Identify quality issues or listing problems.

**Customer service insights.** "Are there customers with open orders who also have open support tickets?" Proactive issue resolution before customers escalate.

**Shipping cost optimization.** "Compare shipping costs by carrier and service level for the last month. Are there savings opportunities?"

**Seasonal planning.** "How did inventory levels, sales velocity, and fulfillment times trend during last year's holiday season?" Data-driven preparation for peak periods.

## Customer Analytics

Ecommerce success depends on understanding customers:

**RFM analysis.** Recency, frequency, monetary analysis to segment customers. "Identify customers who haven't purchased in 90+ days but were previously in our top 20% by spend"  --  perfect for win-back campaigns.

**Cohort analysis.** "How does the 90-day retention rate for customers acquired through TikTok ads compare to those from Google search?"

**Churn prediction.** "Which customers show signs of churn based on declining purchase frequency?" Connect purchase data with email engagement data for a complete picture.

**Product affinity.** "Customers who bought Product A also bought what?" Natural cross-sell and bundle opportunities.

**Lifetime value trends.** "Has average customer LTV increased or decreased this year? Break it down by acquisition channel."

## How CorpusIQ Powers Ecommerce Intelligence

**Unified connector library.** CorpusIQ connects to Shopify, Amazon, eBay, Klaviyo, Mailchimp, Google Ads, Meta Ads, Google Analytics, QuickBooks, Stripe, and more  --  all through a single MCP server.

**Explicit operation boundaries.** Ecommerce retrieval tools are marked read-only. Write-capable connector-management and CorpusIQ control-plane operations are separately named and safety-annotated.

**Real-time queries.** Ask about today's orders and get today's data  --  not yesterday's export. Critical for inventory decisions, fulfillment monitoring, and flash sale performance tracking.

**Cross-source correlation.** The ecommerce value proposition is in the connections between platforms  --  how ad spend translates to orders, how email campaigns drive revenue, how inventory levels align with sales velocity. MCP makes these connections queryable.

**Scalable across channels.** Add new sales channels without adding new reporting complexity. Whether you sell on two platforms or ten, the query interface remains the same  --  one question, one answer, drawing from all connected sources.

## FAQ: Common Questions

<details>
<summary><strong>Which ecommerce platforms does CorpusIQ support?</strong></summary>

CorpusIQ supports Shopify, Amazon Seller Central, and eBay. Support for additional platforms (WooCommerce, BigCommerce, Etsy, Walmart) is expanding.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I see real-time inventory across all channels?</strong></summary>

Yes. Query inventory levels across Shopify, Amazon FBA, and other connected channels in a single query. "What's our total available inventory for each SKU across all channels?"
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How does MCP handle the different data formats from different platforms?</strong></summary>

MCP connectors normalize data at the connector level. Orders from Shopify, Amazon, and eBay are presented in a consistent format, so cross-channel analysis works without manual data transformation.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can MCP help with Amazon PPC optimization?</strong></summary>

Yes. Connect Amazon advertising data alongside order data to analyze which campaigns drive the most profitable sales. Compare Amazon PPC efficiency against Google and Meta ads for a complete advertising picture.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Is this secure for my store data?</strong></summary>

Provider scopes vary by connection. The ecommerce retrieval tools documented here do not write products, orders, or customer records back to their sources; write-capable management/control-plane operations are separate. Connected commerce platforms remain authoritative, and retention follows the published lifecycles.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How does this compare to ecommerce analytics tools like Triple Whale or Northbeam?</strong></summary>

Those tools focus on marketing attribution. MCP provides broader access  --  marketing, yes, but also orders, inventory, customers, finances, and operations. MCP is a general-purpose query layer, not a single-purpose analytics tool.
