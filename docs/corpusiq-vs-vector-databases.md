# CorpusIQ vs Vector Databases  --  MCP Retrieval vs Vector Search

## Introduction

Vector databases (Pinecone, Weaviate, Milvus, Chroma) and CorpusIQ both enable AI to access data  --  but through completely different mechanisms. Vector databases store embeddings of your data and find semantically similar content. CorpusIQ uses the MCP protocol to query live APIs in real time. Understanding the difference is critical for choosing the right architecture for your AI data layer.

The short version: **vector databases are for pre-indexed, static content; CorpusIQ is for live, transactional business data.**

## How Vector Databases Work

1. **Ingest:** Documents, text, or data is split into chunks and converted to vector embeddings using an embedding model.
2. **Index:** Embeddings are stored in a specialized index optimized for similarity search.
3. **Query:** When a user asks a question, it's converted to an embedding. The database finds the most similar stored embeddings.
4. **Retrieve:** The corresponding text chunks are returned and fed to the LLM as context.

Vector databases are excellent for semantic search over unstructured text: documentation, knowledge bases, articles, emails, and other content where you need to find "things like this."

## How CorpusIQ Works

1. **Connect:** Authenticate a data source (HubSpot, QuickBooks, GA4) through OAuth.
2. **Discover:** The AI assistant discovers available MCP tools  --  typed functions for querying contacts, deals, transactions, metrics.
3. **Query:** The AI constructs a structured API call based on the user's natural-language question.
4. **Return:** Live, accurate data flows back to the AI for presentation.

CorpusIQ is designed for structured business data where accuracy, freshness, and completeness matter more than semantic similarity.

## Quick Comparison

| Feature | CorpusIQ (MCP) | Vector Databases |
|---------|---------------|-----------------|
| **Data Type** | Structured business data (CRM, financials, analytics) | Unstructured text, documents, images |
| **Query Mechanism** | Live API calls with typed parameters | Semantic similarity search (k-NN) |
| **Accuracy** | Exact  --  returns specific records | Approximate  --  returns similar content |
| **Freshness** | Real-time (live source) | Stale until re-indexed |
| **Completeness** | Returns all matching records | Returns top-k similar results |
| **Aggregation** | Native (SUM, COUNT, AVG via API) | Not supported |
| **Setup** | 2-minute OAuth | Hours to days (chunking, embedding, indexing) |
| **Data path** | Direct MCP queries sources live; optional indexed search is separate | Full copy to vector store |
| **Cost** | Per-seat subscription | Per-vector storage + compute |

## When Vector Databases Excel

- **Documentation search:** "Find the policy about vacation days"
- **Knowledge bases:** "What's our product return process?"
- **Code search:** "Find functions that handle authentication"
- **Content recommendation:** "Articles similar to this one"
- **Email/chat history:** "Find conversations about the Johnson account"

Vector databases are the right tool when your question is "find me content LIKE this" rather than "give me the EXACT number for this metric."

## When CorpusIQ Excels

- **Business metrics:** "What's our Q2 revenue?"
- **CRM queries:** "Show me all deals closing this month over $50K"
- **Financial data:** "List overdue invoices by customer"
- **Analytics:** "Which ad campaign had the highest ROAS this week?"
- **Cross-source analysis:** "Compare Google Ads spend to GA4 conversion revenue"

CorpusIQ is the right tool when your question requires exact, current, complete data  --  not similar content.

## The RAG Architecture Debate

Many organizations implementing RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) default to vector databases. But for structured business data, this creates unnecessary complexity:

**Vector DB approach for business data:**
```
Source → ETL Pipeline → Embedding Model → Vector DB Index → Similarity Search → LLM
(Problems: stale data, no aggregation, approximate results, complex pipeline)
```

**CorpusIQ approach for business data:**
```
AI → MCP Protocol → Live API → Source → Exact Results → LLM
(Advantages: fresh data, exact results, aggregation, 2-min setup)
```

For structured business data, the vector approach adds latency, cost, and inaccuracy without benefit. You don't need "invoices similar to $500"  --  you need "invoice #12345 for $500."

## A Combined Architecture

The most sophisticated AI implementations use both:

- **Vector database** for unstructured content: documentation, policies, product descriptions, email archives
- **CorpusIQ** for structured business data: CRM, accounting, analytics, operational metrics

The AI assistant routes questions appropriately: semantic queries go to the vector store, exact queries go to CorpusIQ's MCP connectors. This hybrid approach gives users the best of both worlds.

## FAQ

**Q: Can CorpusIQ replace Pinecone or Weaviate?**  
A: For structured business data queries  --  yes. For semantic search over unstructured text  --  no. They serve different data types and query patterns.

**Q: Does CorpusIQ use vector embeddings?**  
A: No. CorpusIQ uses structured API calls, not vector similarity search. This gives exact results for transactional business data.

**Q: Which is faster for business questions?**  
A: CorpusIQ  --  queries complete in 1-5 seconds with exact results. Vector databases require pre-indexing and return approximate top-k results.

**Q: Can I use both together?**  
A: Yes, and this is a recommended architecture. Vector DB handles unstructured content; CorpusIQ handles structured business data. The AI routes queries to the right system.

**Q: Do I need to re-index data with CorpusIQ?**
A: Not for direct MCP, which queries live sources without building an index. Optional indexed search is a separate mode with an embeddings and minimal-metadata lifecycle.

**Q: What about hybrid search (vector + keyword)?**  
A: Vector databases support hybrid search for text. CorpusIQ isn't a search engine  --  it's a protocol layer for structured data access. They're different categories.

**Q: Which is more expensive?**  
A: Vector databases charge for storage, embeddings, and query compute. CorpusIQ charges per seat. For business intelligence use cases, CorpusIQ is typically more cost-effective.

**Q: Can I do aggregations with a vector database?**  
A: No. Vector databases return text chunks, not aggregated numerical data. If you need "total revenue by quarter," you need a structured data system like CorpusIQ.
