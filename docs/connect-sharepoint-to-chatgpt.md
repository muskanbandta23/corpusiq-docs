# How to Connect SharePoint to ChatGPT with CorpusIQ MCP

Your **SharePoint** account holds critical business data  --  but accessing insights usually means logging in, navigating dashboards, and running manual reports. **Connecting SharePoint to ChatGPT through CorpusIQ MCP** eliminates all that friction. Once connected via a secure OAuth flow, ChatGPT can query your live SharePoint data directly  --  you ask questions in plain English, and get cited answers drawn from your actual account, not outdated exports or screenshots.

Once connected, ChatGPT can query your live SharePoint Online environment  --  sites, document libraries, lists, files, and content. You ask questions in plain English and get cited answers from your SharePoint content in real time. Your enterprise intranet becomes a conversational knowledge platform.

This page covers the connection architecture, what you can ask, enterprise knowledge management use cases, security, and how MCP compares to SharePoint's native search and Microsoft Graph API.

## FAQ: Common Questions

<details>
<summary><strong>What SharePoint data can ChatGPT access?</strong></summary>

Sites and subsites with metadata. Document libraries with file listings and metadata. List items with column values. File content for supported formats (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, PDF, text). Site-level permissions and sharing information. All accessed through Microsoft Graph API with read-only permissions  --  ChatGPT reads content, never modifies it.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What questions can I ask ChatGPT about SharePoint?</strong></summary>

Document questions: "Find the latest Q3 financial report in SharePoint", "Show me all policy documents updated this month", "What does the product spec say about the API version?" List questions: "Show me all items in the Vendor Contacts list", "What's in the IT Asset Inventory?", "List all open items in the Facilities Request list." Site questions: "What SharePoint sites do I have access to?", "Show me recent activity on the Marketing team site." Cross-site questions: "Find all documents across SharePoint that mention the rebranding project", "Summarize what our SharePoint documentation says about the security compliance process."
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How does the connection work?</strong></summary>

CorpusIQ connects to SharePoint Online via Microsoft Graph API using OAuth 2.0 with read-only delegated permissions. You authenticate with your Microsoft 365 account, authorize the requested scopes, then connect the CorpusIQ MCP server to ChatGPT. ChatGPT discovers tools for searching SharePoint content, listing sites, reading document content, and querying lists. The MCP server handles Microsoft Graph API pagination, throttling, and content extraction.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Is the connection read-only?</strong></summary>

Yes. CorpusIQ requests read-only delegated permissions from Microsoft Graph: Sites.Read.All, Files.Read.All, User.Read. ChatGPT can discover sites, search documents, read file content, and query lists. It cannot upload files, modify documents, create sites, change permissions, or perform any write operation in SharePoint. The read-only guarantee is enforced by the Microsoft Graph permission scopes.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What types of SharePoint content can ChatGPT read?</strong></summary>

Document content from Word documents, Excel spreadsheets, PowerPoint presentations, PDFs, and text files stored in SharePoint document libraries. List data from SharePoint lists with their column values and metadata. Site pages and their content. File metadata including author, modification date, and sharing status. Note: content access depends on file format support  --  complex formatting may be simplified for text extraction.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can ChatGPT search across multiple SharePoint sites?</strong></summary>

Yes. "Search all SharePoint sites for documents about the compliance audit" searches across every site the authenticated user has access to. "Find all Q3 budget documents across the Finance and Operations sites" narrows search to specific sites while spanning them. This cross-site search capability is more powerful than SharePoint's native search, which requires navigating to each site individually.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How is this different from SharePoint's built-in search?</strong></summary>

SharePoint's built-in search returns document titles and snippets with relevance ranking. It doesn't synthesize answers from document content. With ChatGPT connected via MCP, you can ask "What does our vacation policy say about carryover days?" and get the answer extracted from the actual policy document content  --  not just a link to the document. ChatGPT reads the document, finds the relevant section, and presents the answer directly.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Does this work with on-premises SharePoint?</strong></summary>

CorpusIQ connects to SharePoint Online through Microsoft Graph API. On-premises SharePoint (SharePoint Server) is not directly supported unless it's configured with a hybrid connection to Microsoft 365. For organizations in transition, the SharePoint Online integration provides a path to conversational knowledge access as content migrates to the cloud.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can ChatGPT respect SharePoint's permission model?</strong></summary>

Yes. Microsoft Graph delegated permissions mean ChatGPT can only access sites, documents, and lists that the authenticated user has permission to view in SharePoint. If a document is restricted to a specific group and the user isn't in that group, ChatGPT can't access it. The SharePoint permission model is fully respected  --  the MCP connection doesn't expand anyone's access.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How does this handle large SharePoint environments with thousands of sites?</strong></summary>

ChatGPT can discover sites and narrow searches. "Show me the SharePoint sites I frequently access." "Search the Finance department site for budget documents." "Find the most recently modified documents across all sites." Targeted queries reduce the scope to relevant content. For extremely large environments, specifying the site or document library in your question improves precision.
</details>

## How It Works

1. **Connect SharePoint to CorpusIQ.** Dashboard → Connections → SharePoint / Microsoft 365 → sign into Microsoft 365 → authorize read-only delegated permissions. Takes 2 minutes.

2. **Connect CorpusIQ to ChatGPT.** Add the CorpusIQ MCP server. ChatGPT discovers tools for searching SharePoint, reading documents, querying lists, and discovering sites.

3. **Ask knowledge questions.** ChatGPT identifies relevant SharePoint content, reads documents or queries lists, and returns cited answers with source references.

4. **Drill down.** "Show me the full document" or "What else is in that document library?"  --  follow-ups maintain context.

No SharePoint site navigation. No document library browsing. No manual content reading.

## Benefits

**Conversational enterprise search.** "What does the expense policy say about international travel?" retrieves the policy document, reads the relevant section, and answers directly. Enterprise knowledge becomes answerable without knowing which site or document library holds the answer.

**Cross-document synthesis.** "Summarize all Q3 financial documents  --  budget updates, forecasts, and variance reports" reads across multiple documents and produces a unified summary. This cross-document comprehension is impossible with SharePoint's native search.

**Self-service knowledge access.** Employees across the organization can get SharePoint answers through ChatGPT without learning SharePoint navigation. "Where do I find the IT request form?" "What's the process for ordering equipment?" The intranet becomes accessible to everyone, not just power users.

**Enterprise-wide visibility.** "What SharePoint sites are active in our tenant?" "Show me recently modified documents across the organization." "Which document libraries have the most content?" IT and knowledge management teams get tenant-level visibility.

**Business-connected knowledge.** "Find the contract document for Acme Corp and cross-reference with their HubSpot deal status." "Show me project plans for initiatives with open Jira epics." SharePoint documents become connected to CRM, project management, and business data. This is the unique capability of [MCP platforms like CorpusIQ](benefits-of-mcp-for-business.md).

## Use Cases

### Policy and Compliance Access

"What does our data retention policy require?" "Show me the SOC 2 compliance documentation." "What's the process for a security incident response?" Compliance and policy information becomes instantly accessible to anyone who needs it.

### Document Discovery

"Find the latest version of the product roadmap." "Show me all contracts expiring this quarter." "What proposals are currently in review?" Document discovery that would require navigating multiple SharePoint sites becomes a single question.

### Enterprise Search and Knowledge Management

"Search all SharePoint sites for information about the CRM migration project." "Find all documents authored by the marketing team this month." "What training materials exist for the new ERP system?" Enterprise search that understands document content, not just titles.

### HR and Employee Self-Service

"What's our parental leave policy?" "Show me the performance review template." "Where can I find the benefits enrollment guide?" HR knowledge becomes self-service, reducing the burden on HR teams.

### Cross-Source Research

"Find the contract for Client X in SharePoint and show me their current deal status in HubSpot." "Show me project documentation for initiatives with overdue Jira tasks." "What SharePoint documents reference the product that Stripe is showing payment issues for?" Connecting enterprise documents with live business data creates complete context.

## Security: Enterprise-Grade Read-Only Access

The SharePoint integration is built for enterprise security:

- **Microsoft Graph OAuth 2.0** with delegated permissions. Read-only scopes: Sites.Read.All, Files.Read.All, User.Read.
- **SharePoint Permission Respect.** ChatGPT can only access content the authenticated user has permission to view. Document-level, library-level, and site-level permissions are fully enforced.
- **Scoped direct-MCP retention.** CorpusIQ uses read-only access for direct MCP live retrieval. It does not retain raw customer files or full connector response payloads; operational logs retain query text, per-user tool-call metadata, and bounded outcome summaries for up to 30 days.
- **TLS 1.3 Encryption.** All data in transit is encrypted.
- **Azure AD / Entra ID Integration.** Authentication flows through your Microsoft 365 identity provider. Conditional access policies, MFA, and other identity controls apply.
- **Admin Revocation.** Microsoft 365 admins can revoke the application consent at any time from the Azure AD / Entra ID admin center.

For enterprises in regulated industries, Microsoft 365 remains the authoritative source. CorpusIQ retrieves permitted SharePoint content through direct MCP; the retention classes and lifecycles described above still apply.

## Comparison: MCP vs. SharePoint Native Search

| Aspect | SharePoint Search | CorpusIQ MCP + ChatGPT |
|--------|------------------|------------------------|
| **Search method** | Keyword and metadata matching | Natural language understanding of document content |
| **Result format** | Document links with snippets | Synthesized answers with content citations |
| **Content comprehension** | Surface-level  --  title and snippet matching | Deep  --  reads document body and extracts answers |
| **Cross-document synthesis** | Manual  --  open each document individually | Automatic  --  reads and synthesizes across documents |
| **Cross-source** | SharePoint-only | Connect with CRM, projects, communication, analytics |
| **Accessibility** | SharePoint-trained users | Anyone who can ask a question |

SharePoint's native search is optimized for finding documents by title, metadata, and keywords. MCP with ChatGPT is optimized for answering questions from document content  --  different capabilities that complement each other.
