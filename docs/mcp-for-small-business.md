# MCP for Small Business: How to Connect Your Business Data to AI

**Small Business teams need fast, accurate answers from their business data**  --  but traditional BI tools and manual reporting create bottlenecks that slow decision-making. The Model Context Protocol (MCP) gives small business professionals direct AI-powered access to live data from QuickBooks, Salesforce, HubSpot, Shopify, and 25+ other platforms through natural language queries. No more waiting on data teams for reports  --  just connect your tools and ask questions in plain English.

## Why Small Businesses Need MCP

Small businesses run on the same SaaS platforms as enterprises  --  QuickBooks for accounting, Shopify for ecommerce, HubSpot for CRM, Google Analytics for web traffic. The difference is that small businesses lack the resources to integrate these platforms into a unified view of the business.

The owner of a small retail business might check Shopify for orders, QuickBooks for cash position, and Google Analytics for website traffic  --  three separate logins, three separate dashboards, zero integration. Understanding how marketing spend translates to revenue requires manual spreadsheet work. Getting a clear picture of business health means hours of exporting and combining data.

MCP eliminates this fragmentation. Connect your platforms once through OAuth, and you can ask natural language questions that span all of them. "How much revenue did we generate from email campaigns last month?" "Which products have the best margin?" "Who are our top customers and what have they bought recently?" These are answers that small business owners need but typically can't get without manual effort.

## Affordability: BI Without the Enterprise Price Tag

Traditional business intelligence stacks are expensive:
- **Data warehouse:** $500-$3,000/month for Snowflake or BigQuery
- **ETL tools:** $500-$2,000/month for Fivetran or Stitch
- **BI tool:** $15-$75/user/month for Tableau or Looker
- **Implementation:** $15,000-$50,000 in consulting fees
- **Ongoing maintenance:** 10-20 hours/week of data engineering time

For a small business, this is non-viable. Even the lower end represents a significant fraction of revenue.

CorpusIQ's MCP platform starts at a price point designed for small businesses  --  comparable to a single SaaS subscription rather than an enterprise BI deployment. There's no data warehouse to provision, no ETL pipelines to build, and no implementation consulting required. The setup is self-service OAuth authentication, taking minutes rather than months.

## Quick Setup: From Zero to Insights in Minutes

The setup process for a small business using CorpusIQ:

**1. Create an account.** Sign up through the CorpusIQ platform. No credit card required to start.

**2. Connect QuickBooks.** Authorize CorpusIQ to access your QuickBooks data through OAuth. The advertised financial-data retrieval tools are marked read-only. Write-capable tools, when available, are separately named and annotated.

**3. Connect your CRM.** Authorize HubSpot, Salesforce, or your preferred CRM. Again, read-only access for querying contacts, deals, and pipeline data.

**4. Connect your ecommerce platform.** Authorize Shopify, Amazon Seller Central, or your sales channels.

**5. Connect analytics.** Authorize Google Analytics, Meta Ads, or your marketing platforms.

**6. Ask your first question.** "What was our revenue last month, and how does it compare to the previous month?" The AI assistant queries your QuickBooks data and returns an answer in seconds.

The entire process takes 10-15 minutes. There's no technical expertise required beyond knowing your login credentials for each platform. This is the fundamental value proposition of MCP for small business: enterprise-grade business intelligence without the enterprise-grade setup burden.

## Essential Connectors for Small Business

Not every small business needs 40+ connectors. The essential ones for most SMBs are:

**QuickBooks (or Xero).** Financial data is the foundation of business intelligence. Revenue, expenses, profit margins, cash position, accounts receivable  --  these are the numbers every business owner needs.

**CRM (HubSpot, Salesforce, or similar).** Customer data, sales pipeline, deal tracking. Understanding who your customers are and how your sales process is performing.

**Ecommerce (Shopify, Amazon).** For product-based businesses, order data, inventory levels, product performance, and customer purchase history.

**Marketing (Google Analytics, Meta Ads).** Website traffic, ad performance, campaign ROI. Understanding which marketing efforts drive results.

**Email (Mailchimp, Klaviyo, Constant Contact).** For businesses using email marketing, campaign performance and subscriber metrics.

With these five categories connected, a small business owner can answer virtually every important business question through natural language queries.

## SMB Use Cases

**Daily business health check.** Every morning, ask "What's our revenue so far this month? Any overdue invoices? What's our cash position?" Three questions, three live data queries, complete financial picture in 30 seconds.

**Customer analysis.** "Who are our top 10 customers by lifetime value? Have any of our top customers not ordered in the last 60 days?" Identify your best customers and spot churn risk before it happens.

**Inventory management.** "Which products are running low on inventory? What should we reorder based on recent sales velocity?" Data-driven inventory decisions without spreadsheets.

**Marketing ROI.** "Which ad campaign generated the most revenue last month? What's our customer acquisition cost by channel?" Understand where marketing dollars are working.

**Tax preparation.** "What were our total expenses by category last year? Which vendors did we pay more than $10,000?" Quick access to the data your accountant needs.

**Cash flow monitoring.** "What's our cash position and what payments are coming due this week?" Avoid cash crunches by staying on top of payables and receivables.

## How CorpusIQ Makes This Possible for SMBs

**Flat pricing, not per-seat.** Small businesses don't need to count users. CorpusIQ's pricing is based on platform access tier, not per-user licensing.

**No minimum commitment.** Month-to-month plans let small businesses try the platform without long-term contracts.

**Self-service onboarding.** No implementation calls, no consulting engagements. The setup is designed to be completed by a business owner, not an IT team.

**Read-only external retrieval.** Small business owners can query connected financial systems without the connector tools writing back to those vendor records. Explicit CorpusIQ control-plane changes are separately annotated.

**Mobile-friendly queries.** Ask questions from your phone through any MCP-compatible AI client. Check business health during your morning coffee without opening a laptop.

## FAQ: Common Questions

<details>
<summary><strong>Do I need technical expertise to set up MCP for my small business?</strong></summary>

No. CorpusIQ's setup requires only OAuth authentication  --  clicking "Connect" and logging into each platform. No code, no configuration files, no command line. If you can log into QuickBooks, you can connect it to CorpusIQ.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How much does CorpusIQ cost for a small business?</strong></summary>

CorpusIQ offers plans starting at accessible SMB price points. Visit the CorpusIQ pricing page for current details. Compared to the cost of a part-time bookkeeper or data analyst, MCP access is a fraction of the cost for 24/7 availability.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Is my data secure? Can the AI accidentally delete something?</strong></summary>

CorpusIQ external-source connector tools use read-only retrieval and do not modify, delete, or create records in connected vendor systems such as QuickBooks or Shopify. Explicit CorpusIQ control-plane tools operate only on user-declared CorpusIQ state and carry separate safety annotations.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I connect multiple businesses or clients?</strong></summary>

Yes. If you run multiple businesses or manage books for multiple clients, you can connect separate instances of each platform. Each connection is isolated  --  data from Business A is never mixed with Business B.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What if I only use QuickBooks? Is MCP still useful with one platform?</strong></summary>

Absolutely. Even with just QuickBooks connected, the ability to ask natural language questions about your financials  --  "What were my top 5 expense categories last quarter?"  --  saves significant time compared to running reports manually.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How is this different from just using ChatGPT?</strong></summary>

ChatGPT without MCP can only answer from its training data  --  it can't access your actual QuickBooks, Shopify, or CRM data. With CorpusIQ, the AI assistant queries your live business data and returns specific, accurate answers based on your real numbers.
