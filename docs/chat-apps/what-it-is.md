# What the chat app is

CorpusIQ connects your business tools — accounting, ecommerce, ads, email,
CRM, analytics — and lets you ask questions across them in plain English. The
chat app puts that same ability inside Slack and Microsoft Teams.

You type a question in a direct message to the app, or @-mention it in a
channel. It reads the answer from your connected tools and replies in the
thread.

## What makes it different from the dashboard

The CorpusIQ dashboard and the chat app answer the same kinds of questions from
the same data. The difference is where you are and who sees it.

- **The dashboard** is your private workspace. You go there to connect tools,
  set your AI key, manage billing, and ask questions on your own.
- **The chat app** meets you where your team already talks. Ask in a direct
  message for a private answer, or in a channel where the answer is useful to
  everyone in it.

Nothing about your data changes between the two. The chat app is the same
CorpusIQ, reached from a different place.

## Who the answer comes from

This is the part worth understanding up front: the app answers as **you**.

When you link your account (a one-time step), the app ties your Slack or Teams
identity to your CorpusIQ account. From then on, when you ask a question, it
reads from the tools *you* connected, with *your* permissions. A colleague in
the same workspace who asks the same question gets answers from *their*
connected tools, not yours.

That's why linking exists. Without it, the app has no way to know whose data to
read, so it won't guess — it asks you to link first.

## What it can answer

Anything CorpusIQ can answer anywhere else. The app talks to the same connector
layer as the dashboard and the ChatGPT and Claude integrations, so the range is
the same: revenue and finance, ad performance, email and SMS results, store
orders and inventory, CRM pipeline, web analytics, SEO, and files in your
cloud drives.

If a tool isn't connected yet, the app tells you plainly and points you to
connect it — it doesn't invent an answer.

## What it reads, and what it doesn't

The app is read-only against your business tools. It looks things up and reports
them back. It does not move money, send emails, change records, or post on your
behalf. Answers are drawn live from your connected tools each time you ask —
direct MCP does not retain raw customer files or full connector response payloads; scoped operational logs may persist for up to 30 days.

## Next

Once the app is installed, the setup is three steps and takes a couple of
minutes. Pick your platform:
