# Asking questions

Once you're linked and your AI key is set, this is the whole job: ask, read,
ask again. This page is about asking well and knowing what you'll get back.

## How to ask

- **Direct message** the app for a private answer only you see.
- **@-mention** the app in a channel (`@CorpusIQ ...`) when the answer belongs
  to the whole channel.

Ask the way you'd ask a colleague who has all the numbers in front of them.
Plain English, no special syntax:

> How did revenue compare to last month?

You don't need to name the tool. CorpusIQ works out that "revenue" means your
accounting or payments data and goes there. If a question could mean two things,
it's fine to say which - "revenue from Stripe" or "orders in Shopify" - but you
rarely need to.

## Follow-ups work

Answers live in a thread, and you can keep going in it. Ask a broad question,
then narrow:

> How did sales do last week?

> Just the online store.

> Now break that down by product.

Each reply builds on the last, so you don't have to restate the whole question
every time.

## What the answers look like

CorpusIQ replies with the numbers laid out, not buried in a paragraph. Key
figures come back as tiles in Slack and as cards in Teams - a revenue figure, a
change versus the prior period, a count of orders - so you can read the result
at a glance. Longer explanations come as short text above or beside the tiles.

When a question spans several tools, the answer pulls them together. When it
needs a tool you haven't connected, the reply says so and gives you a way to
connect it rather than guessing.

Two things CorpusIQ won't do: invent a number it can't source, or quietly leave
out a tool it couldn't reach. If data is missing, it tells you.

## Questions worth trying

A starter set across the common areas. Use the ones that match what you've
connected.

### Money and finance

> How much revenue did we bring in last month, and how does that compare to the
> month before?

> What are our biggest outstanding invoices right now?

> What did we spend with our top five vendors this quarter?

### Ads and marketing

> Which ad campaigns had the best return last week?

> Where are we spending the most and getting the least back?

> How did our email campaigns perform this month - opens, clicks, revenue?

### Store and orders

> How many orders are waiting to ship?

> What are my best-selling products in the last 30 days?

> Which products are running low on stock?

### Customers and pipeline

> Which deals are closing this month?

> Who are my highest-value customers this year?

> How many new leads did we get last week, and where did they come from?

### Web and search

> How much traffic did the site get last week, and where did it come from?

> Which pages get the most visits but the fewest sign-ups?

### Across everything

> Give me a quick read on how the business is doing this month.

> What changed the most week over week?

That last kind - the broad "how are we doing" question - is where the chat app
earns its place. One question in a channel, and everyone sees the same answer,
drawn live from the tools behind it.

## If an answer looks off

CorpusIQ shows where a number came from. If something looks wrong, the usual
cause is a tool that isn't connected or a question that could be read two ways.
Ask it to be specific - name the tool or the date range - and see
[troubleshooting.md](troubleshooting.md) if it persists.
