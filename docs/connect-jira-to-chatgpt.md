# How to Connect Jira to ChatGPT with CorpusIQ MCP

Your **Jira** account holds critical business data  --  but accessing insights usually means logging in, navigating dashboards, and running manual reports. **Connecting Jira to ChatGPT through CorpusIQ MCP** eliminates all that friction. Once connected via a secure OAuth flow, ChatGPT can query your live Jira data directly  --  you ask questions in plain English, and get cited answers drawn from your actual account, not outdated exports or screenshots.

Once connected, ChatGPT can query your live Jira data  --  issues, sprints, epics, assignees, status transitions, and project velocity. You ask questions in plain English and get cited answers from your Jira instance  --  no JQL required.

This page covers the connection architecture, what you can ask, agile workflow use cases, security, and how MCP compares to JQL queries and direct Jira API integration.

## FAQ: Common Questions

<details>
<summary><strong>What development questions can I ask ChatGPT about Jira?</strong></summary>

Issue questions: "Show me all open bugs in the current sprint", "What issues are assigned to me?", "Which issues have been in 'In Progress' for more than 5 days?" Sprint questions: "What's the status of Sprint 42?", "How many story points have we completed this sprint?", "What's our velocity over the last 5 sprints?" Epic questions: "What's the status of the Authentication Epic?", "Show me all unresolved issues in Epic X." Release questions: "What issues are targeted for the next release?", "How many bugs are open for the current release?" Team questions: "Who has the most open issues?", "Show me issue distribution by assignee this sprint."
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How does the connection work?</strong></summary>

CorpusIQ connects to your Jira instance (Cloud or Data Center) via OAuth 2.0 or personal access token. You authorize read-only access, then connect the CorpusIQ MCP server to ChatGPT. ChatGPT discovers the available Jira tools  --  issue search, sprint reporting, project listing, and issue retrieval  --  and calls them when you ask a question. The MCP server handles JQL construction, pagination, and field mapping behind the scenes.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Is the connection read-only?</strong></summary>

Yes. CorpusIQ requests read-only permissions from Jira. ChatGPT can see issues, projects, sprints, and reports. It cannot create issues, transition statuses, assign work, comment on issues, or modify anything in your Jira instance. The read-only guarantee is enforced at the Jira permission and MCP tool levels.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What Jira data can ChatGPT access?</strong></summary>

Projects and their metadata. Issues with summary, description, status, assignee, priority, labels, components, and custom fields. Sprints with start/end dates, goal, and completion status. Epics with linked issues and progress. All standard and custom fields are accessible  --  just reference them by name.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can ChatGPT write JQL for me?</strong></summary>

ChatGPT doesn't just write JQL  --  it eliminates the need for JQL entirely. Instead of writing `project = "PLATFORM" AND status = "In Progress" AND assignee = currentUser() ORDER BY priority DESC`, you ask "Show me my in-progress issues in the Platform project, sorted by priority." ChatGPT translates your natural language into the appropriate JQL, executes it, and returns the results. You get JQL-level precision without learning JQL syntax.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can ChatGPT combine Jira data with other development tools?</strong></summary>

Yes. "Show me Jira issues linked to recent GitHub pull requests" or "Which Jira bugs correspond to production incidents in our monitoring dashboard?" Cross-source development visibility connects your issue tracker with your code repository, CI/CD pipeline, and monitoring tools.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can ChatGPT combine Jira with business tools?</strong></summary>

This is where MCP truly differentiates from Jira-native reporting. "Which Jira epics are associated with HubSpot deals closing this quarter?" "Show me open customer-reported bugs and their corresponding Salesforce cases." "Which features being built this sprint map to the highest-value Shopify products?" Connecting development data to business data provides context that isolated Jira reports cannot.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How is this different from Jira's built-in dashboards?</strong></summary>

Jira dashboards are excellent for recurring team-level metrics  --  burndown charts, velocity, issue distributions. But they answer the questions you anticipate, not the questions you discover. "Show me all issues that were reopened more than twice in the last 30 days" is a JQL query and chart you'd need to build specifically  --  or a ChatGPT question that takes seconds. MCP complements Jira dashboards with ad-hoc analytical capability.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Does this work with Jira Cloud and Jira Data Center?</strong></summary>

Yes. CorpusIQ supports both Jira Cloud (via OAuth 2.0) and Jira Data Center (via personal access tokens). Connection setup differs slightly (OAuth for Cloud, PAT for Data Center), but the ChatGPT experience is identical.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I query across multiple Jira projects and boards?</strong></summary>

Yes. "Show me all open issues across the Frontend, Backend, and DevOps projects." "What's the combined velocity across all engineering teams this quarter?" "Which projects have the most unresolved bugs?" Multi-project queries work naturally  --  no need to run separate JQL queries and combine results manually.
</details>

## How It Works

1. **Connect Jira to CorpusIQ.** Dashboard → Connections → Jira → authenticate via OAuth (Cloud) or enter instance URL and PAT (Data Center) → authorize read-only access.

2. **Connect CorpusIQ to ChatGPT.** Add the CorpusIQ MCP server. ChatGPT discovers tools for searching issues, listing projects, retrieving sprints, and accessing reports.

3. **Ask development questions.** ChatGPT translates your natural language into JQL, executes the query through the MCP server, and returns results in readable format.

4. **Iterate.** "Now show me just the P0 and P1 bugs" or "Group those by assignee"  --  follow-ups maintain context across your Jira data.

No JQL. No board switching. No manual issue compilation.

## Benefits

**Development visibility for non-developers.** Product managers, executives, and customer-facing teams can ask Jira questions without learning Jira's interface or JQL. "What's the status of Feature X?" is a ChatGPT question anyone can ask.

**Faster sprint and standup preparation.** "Give me a sprint summary  --  completed issues, remaining work, blockers, and burndown status." Sprint preparation that normally requires navigating multiple Jira views becomes one question.

**Cross-team development insights.** "Show me issues that span both the Frontend and Backend teams." "Which epics have work distributed across the most teams?" Cross-team visibility that's difficult to achieve within Jira's project-oriented structure.

**Business-connected development.** "Which features in the current sprint map to HubSpot deals with Q3 close dates?" "Show me Jira issues for bugs reported by our top 10 revenue customers." Connecting development work to business impact is the unique advantage of [MCP platforms like CorpusIQ](benefits-of-mcp-for-business.md).

**Automated status reporting.** "Summarize engineering progress this week  --  what shipped, what's blocked, what's at risk." Weekly status becomes a conversation instead of compiling Jira data into a slide deck.

## Use Cases

### Daily Engineering Standup

"Give me the standup summary for my team  --  what moved to Done yesterday, what's In Progress, any blockers." Standup preparation in seconds.

### Sprint Planning and Retrospective

"What's our velocity trend over the last 6 sprints?" "Show me carry-over items from the last 3 sprints." "Which types of issues (bugs vs. stories vs. tasks) take the longest to resolve?" Data-driven retrospectives without JQL.

### Release Management

"What issues are in the Release 3.2 scope?" "How many open bugs are blocking the release?" "Show me all unresolved issues with the release label." Release readiness becomes a conversational check.

### Bug Triage

"Show me all unassigned P0 and P1 bugs." "Which bugs have been open the longest?" "Show me bugs by component  --  where are we seeing the most issues?" Bug triage prioritization with live data.

### Cross-Source Development Intelligence

"Show me Jira issues for features that support HubSpot deals in the final negotiation stage." "Which customer-reported bugs correspond to accounts with open Salesforce cases?" "Are there outstanding Jira tasks for products with declining Shopify inventory?" Development work connected to business context.

## Security: Read-Only by Design

The Jira integration is read-only at every layer:

- **OAuth 2.0 / PAT** with read-only permissions. No write, create, transition, or delete permissions.
- **Project Permission Respect.** ChatGPT can only see projects and issues the authenticated user has permission to view in Jira.
- **Scoped direct-MCP retention.** CorpusIQ uses read-only access for direct MCP live retrieval. It does not retain raw customer files or full connector response payloads; operational logs retain query text, per-user tool-call metadata, and bounded outcome summaries for up to 30 days.
- **TLS 1.3 Encryption.** All data in transit is encrypted.

For engineering organizations with sensitive project data, Jira remains the authoritative source. CorpusIQ retrieves permitted Jira records through direct MCP; the retention classes and lifecycles described above still apply.

## Comparison: MCP vs. JQL and Jira API

| Aspect | JQL + Jira Interface | CorpusIQ MCP + ChatGPT |
|--------|---------------------|------------------------|
| **Query method** | JQL syntax with field reference knowledge | Natural language |
| **Learning curve** | JQL syntax, field names, operators | No JQL syntax to learn |
| **Multi-project** | Separate queries with manual combination | One question across all projects |
| **Cross-source** | Jira-only data | Combine with CRM, ecommerce, support tools |
| **Ad-hoc queries** | Write and run each JQL query individually | Conversational  --  ask and get answers |
| **Sharing** | Share JQL links or screenshots | Share ChatGPT conversation context |

| Aspect | Direct Jira API Integration | CorpusIQ MCP |
|--------|---------------------------|--------------|
| **Setup** | API client, OAuth, JQL construction, pagination | 2-minute authentication |
| **Field mapping** | Must handle custom field IDs and schemas | Automatic  --  reference fields by name |
| **Rate limiting** | Must implement backoff and retry logic | Built-in |
| **Maintenance** | API version migrations, custom field changes | CorpusIQ handles updates |

JQL and the Jira API are essential for power users and integrations. For day-to-day status, reporting, and cross-functional visibility, MCP democratizes Jira access across the entire organization.
