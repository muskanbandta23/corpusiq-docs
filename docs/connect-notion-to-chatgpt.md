# How to Connect Notion to ChatGPT with CorpusIQ MCP

Your **Notion** account holds critical business data  --  but accessing insights usually means logging in, navigating dashboards, and running manual reports. **Connecting Notion to ChatGPT through CorpusIQ MCP** eliminates all that friction. Once connected via a secure OAuth flow, ChatGPT can query your live Notion data directly  --  you ask questions in plain English, and get cited answers drawn from your actual account, not outdated exports or screenshots.

Once connected, ChatGPT can query your live Notion workspace  --  pages, databases, blocks, and users. You ask questions in plain English and get cited answers from your actual Notion content in real time. Your company wiki becomes a conversational knowledge base.

This page covers the connection architecture, what you can ask, knowledge management use cases, security, and how MCP compares to Notion's built-in search and API.

## FAQ: Common Questions

<details>
<summary><strong>What knowledge base questions can I ask ChatGPT about Notion?</strong></summary>

Page questions: "What's in our employee onboarding guide?", "Show me the Q3 product roadmap page", "What does our pricing page say about enterprise plans?" Database questions: "Show me all active projects from the Project Tracker database", "What tasks are assigned to me in the Sprint database?", "List all candidates in the Hiring Pipeline database." Cross-page questions: "What's our company policy on remote work?", "Find all pages that mention the API migration", "Summarize what our documentation says about security compliance." Workspace questions: "What databases do we have?", "Show me recently updated pages", "Who are the workspace members?"
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How does the connection work?</strong></summary>

CorpusIQ connects to your Notion workspace via an Internal Integration Token. You create the integration in Notion, grant it read access to specific pages or the entire workspace, then paste the token into CorpusIQ. Once connected, add the CorpusIQ MCP server to ChatGPT. ChatGPT discovers tools for searching pages, querying databases, reading page content, and listing workspace users. The MCP server handles Notion's API, including block traversal, database queries, and pagination.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Is the connection read-only?</strong></summary>

Yes. The Notion integration token is configured with read-only capabilities. ChatGPT can search pages, query databases, and read block content. It cannot create pages, edit content, modify databases, or change anything in your Notion workspace. The read-only guarantee is enforced by the integration token's capabilities in Notion.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What Notion content can ChatGPT access?</strong></summary>

Pages with titles, properties, and content blocks (paragraphs, headings, lists, toggles, callouts). Databases with schema, properties, and row data. Page content through block traversal  --  ChatGPT can read the actual text of your pages, not just metadata. The specific content accessible depends on which pages you've shared with the integration  --  you control exactly what's accessible.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can ChatGPT search across all Notion pages at once?</strong></summary>

Yes. "Search Notion for everything about the Q4 product launch" searches across all pages the integration has access to. "Find all mentions of 'security review' across our documentation" spans the entire integrated workspace. This is significantly more powerful than Notion's built-in search, which returns page titles and snippets  --  ChatGPT reads full page content and synthesizes answers.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How is this different from Notion's built-in AI features?</strong></summary>

Notion AI (Notion's built-in AI assistant) is designed for content creation within Notion  --  writing, summarizing, translating, and editing Notion pages. It works within a single page context. ChatGPT connected via MCP provides cross-page knowledge retrieval: "What does our entire documentation say about the authentication flow?" queries every relevant page and synthesizes an answer. ChatGPT also connects Notion knowledge with data from your other tools  --  CRM, project management, analytics  --  providing business context that isolated Notion AI cannot.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can ChatGPT query Notion databases with filters?</strong></summary>

Yes. "Show me all tasks in the Engineering Sprint database where Status is 'In Progress' and Priority is 'High'" works naturally. "List all candidates in the Hiring Pipeline who are in the 'Final Interview' stage." Database queries with property filters work through natural language  --  no need to build Notion database views or filter configurations.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What about access control  --  can ChatGPT see private pages?</strong></summary>

ChatGPT can only access pages that have been explicitly shared with the Notion integration. If a page isn't shared with the integration, ChatGPT can't see it  --  even if the authorizing user can. This is a Notion API design constraint that actually provides stronger access control: you must explicitly grant the integration access to each top-level page or database, providing fine-grained control over what ChatGPT can query.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How does this handle large Notion workspaces with thousands of pages?</strong></summary>

ChatGPT can search across the workspace efficiently. "Search for pages about the rebranding project" narrows results to relevant content. For database queries, filtering reduces result sets. "Show me the 10 most recently updated pages" provides a quick workspace overview. The search-first approach means ChatGPT finds relevant content without needing to read every page.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can ChatGPT extract structured data from Notion databases?</strong></summary>

Yes. Notion databases are structured collections with typed properties  --  text, select, multi-select, date, number, person, formula. ChatGPT can query these with property filters and return structured results. "Show me all projects with a deadline this month, sorted by priority" returns structured project data from your Notion project database.
</details>

## How It Works

1. **Create a Notion integration.** In Notion, go to Settings → Integrations → Create new integration. Give it a name and select read-only capabilities. Copy the integration token.

2. **Share pages with the integration.** In Notion, for each top-level page or database you want ChatGPT to access, click Share → invite your integration.

3. **Connect Notion to CorpusIQ.** Dashboard → Connections → Notion → paste your integration token. CorpusIQ validates the token and confirms connected pages.

4. **Connect CorpusIQ to ChatGPT.** Add the CorpusIQ MCP server. ChatGPT discovers tools for searching, reading pages, querying databases, and listing users.

5. **Ask knowledge questions.** ChatGPT searches your Notion workspace, reads relevant pages, and returns cited answers with page references.

No manual page navigation. No database filter building. Knowledge retrieval becomes conversational.

## Benefits

**Conversational knowledge retrieval.** Instead of searching Notion for keywords and clicking through pages, ask "What's our refund policy?" or "How do we handle PTO requests?" and get the answer synthesized from your actual documentation. Your company wiki becomes a conversational knowledge base.

**Cross-document synthesis.** "Summarize everything our documentation says about the API authentication flow" reads across multiple pages and databases and produces a unified answer. This cross-document synthesis is something Notion's built-in search cannot do.

**Database-powered Q&A.** "Show me all active projects with a deadline this quarter" or "List all open positions with their hiring manager"  --  your Notion databases become queryable by natural language, not just by building database views.

**Business-connected knowledge.** "Show me the project brief for the HubSpot deal with Acme Corp" or "What's our documentation say about the integration that the Stripe team is asking about?" Notion knowledge connected to CRM and payment data provides richer context than isolated documentation. This cross-source capability is unique to [MCP platforms like CorpusIQ](benefits-of-mcp-for-business.md).

**Accelerated onboarding.** New hires can ask ChatGPT about company policies, project documentation, and team processes  --  getting answers from Notion without knowing which pages to look at or how the workspace is organized.

## Use Cases

### Company Knowledge Base

"What's our travel policy?" "How do I set up my development environment?" "What's the process for submitting an expense report?" Company policies and procedures become instantly answerable.

### Project Documentation

"Summarize the Q3 Product Launch project plan." "What decisions were documented in the architecture review?" "Show me all meeting notes from the design sprint." Project knowledge retrieval without navigating nested page hierarchies.

### HR and People Operations

"Show me our benefits documentation." "What's in the new hire checklist?" "List all open roles from the Hiring database." HR knowledge becomes self-service for employees.

### Product and Engineering Documentation

"What does our API documentation say about rate limiting?" "Show me the database schema documentation." "Find all pages that reference the deprecated endpoint." Technical documentation becomes queryable by anyone, not just those who know where the docs live.

### Cross-Source Research

"What do our Notion project plans say about the HubSpot integration, and what's the status of related HubSpot deals?" "Find Notion documentation about the payment flow and cross-reference with Stripe transaction data." Combining documentation with live business data provides complete context.

## Security: Read-Only with Fine-Grained Access Control

The Notion integration provides layered security:

- **Integration Token** with read-only capabilities. No content creation, editing, or deletion.
- **Page-Level Sharing.** You explicitly share each top-level page and database with the integration. Unshared pages are inaccessible regardless of workspace membership.
- **Scoped direct-MCP retention.** Notion retrieval tools are marked read-only. It does not retain raw customer files or full connector response payloads; operational logs retain query text, per-user tool-call metadata, and bounded outcome summaries for up to 30 days.
- **TLS 1.3 Encryption.** All data in transit is encrypted.
- **Provider authorization.** Manage the integration token through Notion; provider-side timing remains governed by Notion.

For organizations with sensitive documentation  --  IP, strategy, customer data  --  this architecture provides granular access control: expose only the pages you want ChatGPT to access, and manage provider authorization in Notion when needed.

## Comparison: MCP vs. Notion Built-in Search

| Aspect | Notion Built-in Search | CorpusIQ MCP + ChatGPT |
|--------|----------------------|------------------------|
| **Search method** | Keyword matching on titles and content | Natural language understanding of full content |
| **Result format** | Page title links with snippets | Synthesized answers with page citations |
| **Cross-document synthesis** | Manual  --  open each page and read | Automatic  --  AI reads and synthesizes across pages |
| **Database queries** | Build views with filters | Natural language queries with property filters |
| **Cross-source** | Notion-only | Connect with CRM, projects, analytics, communication |
| **Context** | Page-level only | Conversational context builds across questions |

Notion's built-in search is excellent for navigating a known workspace. MCP with ChatGPT excels at answering questions where the answer may span multiple pages  --  or where you're not sure which page holds the answer.
