# CorpusIQ vs Data Warehouses  --  MCP Live Query vs Stored Data

## Introduction

Data warehouses  --  Snowflake, Google BigQuery, Amazon Redshift, Databricks  --  are the backbone of modern analytics. They store massive amounts of structured data and power BI dashboards, SQL queries, and ML models. CorpusIQ offers a fundamentally different approach: instead of moving data to a warehouse and querying it there, CorpusIQ queries data where it lives  --  in real time, through the MCP protocol.

This isn't a replacement scenario. It's about understanding when a warehouse is essential and when direct AI-powered querying delivers faster, simpler, and cheaper results.

## The Warehouse Model

The traditional data warehouse architecture:

```
Sources (CRM, ERP, Analytics, DBs)
    ↓ ETL/ELT (Fivetran, Airbyte, dbt)
Data Warehouse (Snowflake, BigQuery)
    ↓ SQL / BI Tools
Analysts → Dashboards & Reports
```

This model works for: centralized analytics, historical analysis, complex SQL, regulatory compliance, and formal reporting. It requires significant investment in infrastructure, engineering, and maintenance.

## The CorpusIQ Model

```
AI Assistant → MCP Protocol → CorpusIQ → Live API → Source
```

This model works for instant business questions, AI-powered analysis, cross-source intelligence, and non-technical user access. It avoids a customer-managed ETL warehouse while using live source queries and scoped operational retention.

## Quick Comparison

| Feature | CorpusIQ (MCP) | Data Warehouses |
|---------|---------------|-----------------|
| **Data Location** | Queries live source | Stores copy of data |
| **Query Interface** | Natural language via AI | SQL, BI tools |
| **Freshness** | Real-time | Batch-dependent (hours to days) |
| **Setup** | 2 minutes | Weeks to months |
| **Infrastructure** | None (fully managed) | Warehouse + ETL + BI tools |
| **AI Integration** | Native MCP protocol | Requires separate tooling |
| **Historical Analysis** | Limited to API history | Full historical data |
| **Cost** | Per-seat subscription | $10K-100K+/month (total stack) |
| **Users** | Business users, executives | Analysts, data engineers |
| **Complex Transformations** | Not supported | Full SQL/dbt transformations |
| **Compliance/Governance** | Source remains authoritative; scoped retention applies | Centralized control |

## When Warehouses Are Essential

Data warehouses are irreplaceable for:

1. **Regulatory compliance:** Financial services, healthcare, and government often require centralized, auditable data stores.

2. **Historical trend analysis:** Analyzing 5+ years of data across dozens of dimensions requires pre-aggregated, indexed warehouse storage.

3. **Complex SQL:** Multi-page queries with window functions, subqueries, and custom aggregations are warehouse territory.

4. **BI tool integration:** Tableau, Power BI, Looker, and Metabase connect to warehouses, not live APIs.

5. **Machine learning:** Training ML models requires large, clean, unified datasets  --  a warehouse's sweet spot.

6. **Data quality enforcement:** Warehouses enable centralized data validation, deduplication, and standardization.

## When CorpusIQ Is Better

CorpusIQ is superior for:

1. **Speed to insight:** Ask "What's our pipeline this quarter?" and get an answer in seconds  --  not after finding an analyst, waiting for a report, or writing SQL.

2. **Business user access:** Non-technical users can query data in natural language. No SQL training, no BI tool onboarding.

3. **Cross-source queries:** "Compare HubSpot pipeline to QuickBooks revenue" spans systems that would take weeks to unify in a warehouse.

4. **Real-time accuracy:** Deals, transactions, and metrics that changed 30 seconds ago are immediately available.

5. **Cost efficiency:** For AI-powered business questions, CorpusIQ's per-seat pricing is a fraction of the total warehouse stack cost.

6. **Smaller retained-data surface:** Direct MCP avoids a raw-file/full-payload warehouse while retaining scoped operational logs.

## The Modern Data Stack

Forward-thinking organizations deploy both:

```
Warehouse Layer (Snowflake/BigQuery): Historical data, compliance, BI dashboards, ML
        +
AI Access Layer (CorpusIQ/MCP): Real-time queries, natural-language access, business user self-service
```

The warehouse handles the "single source of truth" for formal analytics. CorpusIQ handles the "I need an answer now" layer for business users and AI assistants.

## Cost Comparison

A typical mid-market company's analytics stack:
- **Warehouse approach:** Snowflake ($5-15K/mo) + Fivetran ($5-10K/mo) + dbt ($1-3K/mo) + BI tool ($3-10K/mo) + data engineers ($10-20K/mo salary allocation) = **$24-58K/month**
- **CorpusIQ for AI queries:** $50-200/seat/month for instant business intelligence = **$500-2,000/month** for a 10-person team

For the specific use case of "answering business questions with AI," CorpusIQ delivers 90%+ of the value at 5-10% of the cost.

## FAQ

**Q: Can CorpusIQ replace Snowflake?**  
A: For AI-powered business queries  --  yes. For formal BI reporting, historical analysis, and ML  --  no. They solve different problems.

**Q: Do I still need a data warehouse if I use CorpusIQ?**  
A: Depends on your needs. If you require formal BI dashboards, regulatory data retention, or ML training sets, a warehouse is still necessary. If your primary need is AI-powered business questions, CorpusIQ may be sufficient.

**Q: How does query performance compare?**  
A: Warehouses are optimized for scanning billions of rows. CorpusIQ is optimized for the API calls that answer business questions. For a question like "show me top 10 customers by revenue," both return results in seconds  --  but CorpusIQ doesn't require data to be loaded into the warehouse first.

**Q: Can I query historical data with CorpusIQ?**  
A: CorpusIQ queries what the source API provides. If HubSpot's API returns 2 years of deal history, that's what you get. For longer historical analysis, a warehouse is necessary.

**Q: Is the data in CorpusIQ as reliable as warehouse data?**  
A: CorpusIQ queries live sources  --  so the data is exactly what's in your operational systems. Warehouses have data that's been transformed, cleaned, and validated. Both are reliable; they just represent slightly different versions of truth (operational vs analytical).

**Q: Can I run complex SQL with CorpusIQ?**  
A: No. CorpusIQ translates natural language to API calls, not SQL. For complex multi-table joins and window functions, a warehouse is the right tool.

**Q: How does security compare?**  
A: Warehouses offer centralized access control. CorpusIQ inherits permissions from source systems. Both are enterprise-grade; the choice depends on your governance model.
