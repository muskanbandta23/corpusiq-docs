# Connect Slack to Claude: Unlock Your Team's Knowledge Base

Slack is where your organization's institutional knowledge lives  --  decisions, discussions, project updates, customer conversations, and tribal knowledge that isn't documented anywhere else. But Slack's search is limited, and finding the right conversation from six months ago often means scrolling through hundreds of messages. Connecting Slack to Claude via CorpusIQ's MCP platform transforms Slack from a message archive into a queryable knowledge base.

Ask Claude "What was the decision on the Q3 pricing strategy?", "Find conversations about [customer name] from the last month", or "Summarize the #product-launch channel activity this week" and receive accurate, context-rich answers drawn from your live Slack workspace.

## Why Connect Slack to Claude?

Slack contains answers to thousands of questions your team asks every day  --  but those answers are buried in message threads, scattered across channels, and inaccessible through Slack's surface-level search. Claude becomes the intelligence layer that surfaces exactly what you need.

**Key benefits:**

- **Instant knowledge retrieval.** "What did the engineering team decide about the API rate limit issue?"  --  answered from real Slack conversations.
- **Cross-channel synthesis.** Claude can pull context from multiple channels to answer complex questions.
- **Customer conversation intelligence.** Search for all mentions of a customer across public channels to understand account health.
- **Project status at a glance.** "Summarize this week's activity in #product-development" without reading every message.
- **Onboarding acceleration.** New team members can ask Claude about past decisions, processes, and tribal knowledge that would otherwise take months to absorb.
- **Meeting and decision capture.** "What was decided in the Q2 planning thread?"  --  instant retrieval of organizational decisions.

## How It Works

1. **Connect Slack** via OAuth 2.0. CorpusIQ requests read-only access to channels, messages, and files in your workspace.
2. **Ask Claude** any question about your team's communications.
3. **CorpusIQ searches** Slack's API for relevant messages, threads, and files using your stored credentials.
4. **Claude synthesizes** the results into a coherent, contextual response.

Claude can search across public channels and private channels it has been added to. Direct messages are never accessible.

## Setup Steps

1. Navigate to **Connectors** in CorpusIQ.
2. Select **Slack** from the integration catalog.
3. Click **"Connect Slack"**  --  authorize via Slack OAuth.
4. Review the workspace permissions (channels:read, channels:history, search:read, files:read).
5. Start asking Claude about your team's conversations.

## Example Claude Queries

**Knowledge Retrieval:**
- "What was the outcome of the discussion about switching payment processors?"
- "Find all conversations about security incidents from the last quarter."
- "Who was involved in the decision to change our onboarding flow?"

**Customer Intelligence:**
- "Show me all Slack mentions of [Company Name] from the last 30 days."
- "What's the sentiment in conversations about our latest product release?"
- "Which team members have discussed [Customer] recently?"

**Project Management:**
- "Summarize this week's activity in #engineering-sprint."
- "What blockers were discussed in #product-launch?"
- "Find all messages about the Q4 roadmap."

**Team Operations:**
- "What recurring questions are people asking in #help-desk?"
- "Show me files shared in #design-reviews this month."
- "What's the top discussion topic in #general this week?"

**Cross-Source:**
- "Correlate Slack mentions of a product launch with Shopify order spikes." (requires Shopify)
- "Find Slack discussions about deals and cross-reference with HubSpot pipeline." (requires HubSpot)

## Security and Privacy

- **Read-only OAuth.** Claude can search and read messages but can never send messages, create channels, or modify workspace settings.
- **No direct message access.** Claude can only search public channels and private channels it has been explicitly invited to.
- **Scoped direct-MCP retention.** CorpusIQ uses read-only access for direct MCP live retrieval. It does not retain raw customer files or full connector response payloads; operational logs retain query text, per-user tool-call metadata, and bounded outcome summaries for up to 30 days.
- **Workspace admin control.** Slack workspace admins can revoke access at any time.

## Comparison: MCP vs. Slack API Direct

| Aspect | CorpusIQ MCP | Slack API Direct |
|---|---|---|
| Setup | 5-minute OAuth | Developer integration required |
| Natural language | Yes | No |
| Search intelligence | Claude's AI understanding + Slack search | Basic keyword search |
| Cross-source correlation | Built-in | Not possible |
| Non-technical access | Anyone can query | Developers and admins only |

## FAQ

**Q: Can Claude read direct messages or private channels?**
A: Claude can only access public channels and private channels it has been explicitly added to. Direct messages are never accessible.

**Q: Can Claude send messages to Slack?**
A: The advertised Slack retrieval tools are read-only and do not send messages. Write-capable tools, when available, are separately named and annotated.

**Q: How far back can Claude search?**
A: Claude can search your entire message history, subject to your Slack workspace's retention settings.

**Q: Does this work with Slack Enterprise Grid?**
A: Yes. The OAuth flow works across all Slack plans.

**Q: Can I restrict which channels Claude can search?**
A: Grant CorpusIQ access only to specific channels by configuring your Slack app's channel scope during OAuth.
