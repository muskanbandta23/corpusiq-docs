# How to Connect NetSuite to Claude with CorpusIQ MCP

Oracle NetSuite is the ERP backbone for thousands of enterprises  --  managing financials, inventory, orders, procurement, and CRM in one platform. But accessing NetSuite data for analysis typically requires SuiteScript developers, saved searches, or expensive BI integrations. Connecting NetSuite to Claude via CorpusIQ's MCP platform eliminates those barriers.

Ask Claude "What's our inventory position across all warehouses?", "Show me open purchase orders by vendor", or "What's our consolidated P&L by subsidiary?" and receive instant, accurate answers from your live NetSuite data. No SuiteScript. No saved searches. No consultant engagement.

### Why Connect NetSuite to Claude?

NetSuite is powerful but notoriously difficult to query  --  especially for non-technical users. Claude becomes the natural language interface that makes NetSuite data accessible to every department.

**Key benefits:**

- **Financial intelligence for everyone.** Finance, operations, and executive teams can query P&L, balance sheet, and financial reports without NetSuite training.
- **Inventory visibility.** "Which SKUs are below reorder point across all warehouses?"  --  answered in seconds.
- **Order and procurement tracking.** "Show me all purchase orders that haven't been received."
- **Cross-subsidiary consolidation.** Query data across multiple subsidiaries in a single Claude conversation.
- **Cross-source enterprise intelligence.** Combine NetSuite financials with Salesforce pipeline, Stripe payments, or Shopify orders.
- **Read-only security.** Token-based authentication with read-only access. Claude can never modify your ERP data.

### How It Works

1. **Connect NetSuite** using Token-Based Authentication (TBA) with read-only permissions.
2. **Ask Claude** any business question related to your ERP data.
3. **CorpusIQ translates** your question into NetSuite SuiteTalk REST API calls.
4. **Claude presents** the results with analysis and context.

### Setup Steps

1. In NetSuite, create an **integration record** and generate read-only TBA tokens.
2. In CorpusIQ, navigate to **Connectors** and select **NetSuite**.
3. Enter your **Account ID, Consumer Key, Consumer Secret, Token ID, and Token Secret.**
4. Configure which record types Claude can access.
5. Start asking Claude ERP questions.

### Example Claude Queries

**Financial Management:**
- "Show me our P&L by subsidiary for the last quarter."
- "What's our current balance sheet position?"
- "Which departments are over budget this month?"
- "What's our AP aging and which vendors are we paying late?"

**Inventory & Supply Chain:**
- "Which SKUs have inventory below their reorder point?"
- "What's our inventory turnover rate by product category?"
- "Show me open purchase orders by expected delivery date."
- "Which warehouse locations have excess inventory?"

**Order Management:**
- "What's our order backlog by status?"
- "Show me all sales orders that haven't been fulfilled."
- "What's our average order-to-cash cycle time?"

**Customer Analysis:**
- "Who are our top 20 customers by revenue this year?"
- "Show me customers with outstanding balances over 60 days."
- "What's the geographic distribution of our customer base?"

### Security

- **TBA with read-only role.** Create a dedicated NetSuite role with only read permissions.
- **Scoped direct-MCP retention.** CorpusIQ uses read-only access for direct MCP live retrieval. It does not retain raw customer files or full connector response payloads; operational logs retain query text, per-user tool-call metadata, and bounded outcome summaries for up to 30 days.
- **Token encryption.** All credentials encrypted at rest.

### Comparison: MCP vs. NetSuite API Direct

| Natural language | Yes | No  --  REST/SOAP queries only |
| Cross-source | Built-in | Custom data warehouse |
| Saved search equivalent | Automatic query construction | Must build saved searches |
| Non-technical access | Anyone | NetSuite admins only |
