# MCP for Agencies: How to Connect Your Business Data to AI

**Agencies teams need fast, accurate answers from their business data**  --  but traditional BI tools and manual reporting create bottlenecks that slow decision-making. The Model Context Protocol (MCP) gives agencies professionals direct AI-powered access to live data from QuickBooks, Salesforce, HubSpot, Shopify, and 25+ other platforms through natural language queries. No more waiting on data teams for reports  --  just connect your tools and ask questions in plain English.

## The Agency Data Challenge

A typical mid-size agency manages 15-30 active clients. Each client might use:
- A different CRM (HubSpot, Salesforce, Pipedrive)
- Different advertising platforms (Google Ads, Meta Ads, LinkedIn Ads, TikTok)
- Different analytics tools (GA4, Adobe Analytics, Mixpanel)
- Different ecommerce platforms (Shopify, Magento, WooCommerce)
- Different email marketing tools (Mailchimp, Klaviyo, HubSpot)

That's potentially hundreds of data source combinations. Traditional approaches require agency analysts to log into each platform for each client, export data, normalize it in spreadsheets, and build reports manually. For a monthly reporting cycle across 20 clients, this easily consumes 80-120 hours of analyst time.

MCP eliminates this fragmentation. Connect each client's platforms once, and query all of them through a single natural language interface. Generate client reports, answer ad-hoc questions, and surface insights without the manual export-normalize-report cycle.

## Multi-Account Management

CorpusIQ's architecture supports agency multi-account management through:

**Client-isolated connections.** Each client's data sources are connected as separate, isolated instances. Client A's Shopify data never mixes with Client B's Shopify data. The isolation is enforced at the infrastructure level, not through fragile naming conventions or folder structures.

**Unified query interface.** Despite the isolation, agency users query all clients through a single interface. Ask "how did Client A's ad performance compare to Client B's this month?" and the AI assistant queries both sets of data sources and presents a comparison.

**Client tagging and organization.** Organize clients by industry, service tier, account manager, or any custom taxonomy. Filter queries by tag  --  "show me ecommerce revenue trends for all retail clients"  --  for portfolio-level insights.

**Account manager access controls.** Assign specific clients to specific account managers. An account manager responsible for five clients sees only those five clients' data sources. Senior leadership can see the full portfolio.

**Client-specific contexts.** Each client connection can have its own canonical definitions. "Active customer" might mean something different for a B2B SaaS client than for a D2C ecommerce client. CorpusIQ maintains these definitions per client.

### Google Ads uses a manager hierarchy

Google Ads is the important exception to the "one separate connection per client" pattern. An ad agency should create a Google Ads Manager Account (MCC), link each client advertiser account beneath it, and give one agency-controlled Google identity access at the manager level. The agency then connects that identity to CorpusIQ once.

Do not create a new Google email and password for every client. The client keeps its own account and users. The MCC link gives the agency's designated identity inherited access, while CorpusIQ automatically discovers linked sub-managers and advertiser accounts.

See [Google Ads for agencies: manager account setup](connectors/google-ads-for-agencies.md) for the requirements, Google click path, verification prompt, and troubleshooting steps.

## Automated Client Reporting

Monthly client reporting is one of the biggest time sinks in agency operations. MCP transforms this from a manual process to an automated one:

**Report templates as prompts.** Define report templates as MCP prompts  --  structured query sequences that produce consistent outputs. A monthly performance report might include: revenue summary, channel breakdown, top campaigns, customer acquisition metrics, and key trends.

**On-demand report generation.** Instead of spending days building reports before each client meeting, generate the report on demand. "Generate the monthly performance report for Client A" triggers a sequence of queries and produces a formatted output.

**Consistent formatting.** Because reports are generated from templates, every client gets consistently structured deliverables. The format is professional and repeatable, not dependent on which analyst built the spreadsheet.

**Historical comparisons.** Reports automatically include period-over-period comparisons. "Show me this month vs last month vs same month last year"  --  the MCP server queries the necessary time ranges and the AI model presents the comparison.

**Ad-hoc client questions.** During client meetings, answer questions in real time. The client asks "how did that email campaign perform compared to our average?" and you have the answer in seconds, without tabbing through dashboards.

## White-Label Possibilities

Agencies that want to offer AI-powered analytics as a branded service can leverage CorpusIQ's white-label capabilities:

**Branded interface.** Deploy the query interface under your agency's domain and branding. Clients interact with your branded AI assistant, not CorpusIQ directly.

**Custom prompt library.** Build a library of prompts and report templates that reflect your agency's methodology and terminology. "Generate a [Agency Name] Performance Snapshot for [Client]" uses your frameworks.

**Embedded analytics.** Embed MCP-powered analytics directly into your client portal. Clients log into your platform and ask questions about their data through your interface.

**Service tier differentiation.** Offer MCP-powered analytics as a premium service tier. Basic clients get standard monthly reports; premium clients get real-time AI-powered business intelligence.

**Methodology integration.** Your agency's analytical frameworks become part of the MCP prompt templates. The AI applies your methodology consistently across all clients, scaling your expertise.

## Use Cases by Agency Type

**Marketing agencies.** "Which channels are driving the highest ROAS across all our clients?" Portfolio-level benchmarking. "Which client campaigns need attention this week?" Proactive monitoring.

**Creative agencies.** "How did the rebrand impact website engagement metrics?" Connect analytics before and after creative work to demonstrate impact. "Which creative assets are performing best across campaigns?"

**SEO agencies.** "What's the organic traffic trend for each client?" Query Google Search Console and GA4 data across the portfolio. "Which keywords are driving the most conversions?" Connect ranking data to revenue.

**PR agencies.** "How much earned media coverage did our campaign generate?" Connect media monitoring tools. "What's the sentiment trend?" Track brand perception over time.

**Consulting agencies.** "Compare the financial performance of all portfolio companies." For private equity or venture capital consulting. "Which operational metrics are improving and which need attention?"

**Web development agencies.** "What's the conversion rate before and after the site redesign?" Quantify the impact of development work. "Are there any technical SEO issues affecting client sites?"

## How CorpusIQ Supports Agency Operations

**Flexible pricing for agencies.** Agency pricing accommodates multi-client portfolios without per-client fees that would make the service uneconomical. Pricing scales with the agency's size and number of connected platforms, not per-client-reporting-relationship.

**Team collaboration.** Multiple team members can access the same client connections simultaneously. Account managers, analysts, and strategists all work from the same data sources.

**Knowledge transfer.** When account managers change, the new manager inherits access to all client connections and historical query context. No knowledge walks out the door when an employee leaves.

**Scalable onboarding.** Adding a new client takes minutes: connect their platforms through OAuth, and they're immediately queryable. No ramp-up time for analysts to learn a new client's tech stack.

**Portfolio analytics.** Beyond individual client reporting, agencies can analyze their entire portfolio. "Which industries have the highest average client ROAS?" "What's our aggregate client revenue growth this quarter?"

## FAQ: Common Questions

<details>
<summary><strong>How do you keep client data separate?</strong></summary>

Each client's data source connections are cryptographically isolated. Client A's Shopify token cannot access Client B's data. The isolation is at the infrastructure level, not through application logic that could be misconfigured.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can clients access their own data through the platform?</strong></summary>

Yes. CorpusIQ supports client-specific access where each client can query their own data without seeing other clients. This is useful for agencies that want to offer self-service analytics as a client benefit.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What's the onboarding process for a new client?</strong></summary>

The agency sends the client OAuth authorization links for each relevant platform. The client authorizes access (read-only by default). Once authorized, the agency can immediately query the client's data. Total time: typically 15-30 minutes per client.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How does reporting work when clients use different platforms?</strong></summary>

MCP's tool discovery mechanism abstracts the underlying platform differences. A "revenue" query works whether the client uses Shopify, Stripe, or QuickBooks  --  the MCP server routes to the appropriate connector for each client.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can we build custom report templates that reflect our agency's methodology?</strong></summary>

Yes. Custom prompts let you define report templates that apply your agency's specific frameworks, terminology, and formatting. These templates are reusable across all clients.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How does pricing work for agencies with growing client lists?</strong></summary>

Agency pricing is designed to scale predictably. Contact CorpusIQ for agency-specific pricing that accommodates portfolio growth without per-client add-on costs.
