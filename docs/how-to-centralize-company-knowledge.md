# How to Centralize Company Knowledge

## The Problem

Company knowledge is fragmented. Policies live in Google Drive. Customer history lives in HubSpot. Financial decisions live in email threads. Product specs live in Notion. Tribal knowledge lives in Slack channels. When someone needs to know "What's our enterprise pricing model and which customers are on which plan?" they need to check 5+ different systems  --  or ask 5 different people.

Traditional solutions  --  wikis, intranets, knowledge bases  --  try to solve this by creating yet another place where information lives. But they require manual updates, constant curation, and still become stale within weeks.

## The Solution: AI-Powered Knowledge Centralization

CorpusIQ takes a fundamentally different approach. Instead of asking you to move your knowledge into a new system, it connects to ALL your existing systems and makes them AI-queryable. No migration. No manual updates. No stale information. Just connect your tools and ask questions  --  the AI finds answers across every connected source.

## What You'll Need

- CorpusIQ account
- MCP-compatible AI assistant
- List of knowledge-containing systems to connect priority-ordered

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Inventory Your Knowledge Sources

Map where each type of knowledge currently lives:

| Knowledge Type | Where It Lives | Priority |
|---------------|----------------|----------|
| **Company Policies** | Google Drive, Notion, Confluence | HIGH |
| **Customer Information** | HubSpot, Salesforce | HIGH |
| **Product Documentation** | Notion, Google Drive, GitHub | HIGH |
| **Financial Information** | QuickBooks, Stripe, Google Drive | MEDIUM |
| **Process & Procedures** | Google Drive, Notion, Slack | MEDIUM |
| **Project Information** | Monday.com, Asana, Notion | MEDIUM |
| **Team Communication** | Slack, Gmail, Outlook | MEDIUM |
| **HR Information** | Google Drive, dedicated HR tools | LOW (for general access) |

### Step 2: Connect Knowledge Sources Through CorpusIQ

Connect your highest-priority sources first:

1. **Document storage:** Google Drive, OneDrive, or Dropbox  --  policies, SOPs, specs
2. **Wiki/Notes:** Notion  --  team documentation, project specs
3. **CRM:** HubSpot  --  customer records, deal history, account context
4. **Communication:** Slack, Gmail  --  decisions, discussions, tribal knowledge
5. **Project Management:** Monday.com  --  project status, tasks, owners

Each connection: CorpusIQ Dashboard → Add Connector → OAuth → Done (60 seconds).

### Step 3: Map Your Knowledge Queries

Define the types of questions each team should be able to answer:

**Anyone in the company:**
- "What's our vacation policy?"
- "How do I submit an expense report?"
- "What's the Wi-Fi password for the NYC office?"
- "When is the next company all-hands?"

**Sales Team:**
- "What's the full history with Acme Corp across all our systems?"
- "Which case studies are relevant for manufacturing prospects?"
- "What's our current pricing for enterprise customers?"

**Engineering Team:**
- "What's the API authentication architecture?"
- "Where's the deployment runbook for the payment service?"
- "What decisions were made about the database migration?"

**Customer Success:**
- "Which customers are on which pricing plan?"
- "What's our SLA for enterprise support tickets?"
- "Show me all communication with customer X in the last month"

### Step 4: Establish Knowledge Hygiene

An AI-powered knowledge system is only as good as its source data. Establish practices:

1. **Single source of truth:** For each knowledge type, designate one authoritative source
2. **Update, don't duplicate:** When a policy changes, update the source document  --  don't create a new one
3. **Archive, don't delete:** Old policies should be archived, not deleted, so historical questions can still be answered
4. **Consistent naming:** Use clear, searchable names for documents and folders

### Step 5: Measure and Improve

Track the impact of centralized knowledge:

- **Time saved:** How many "where do I find..." questions decrease?
- **Onboarding speed:** How much faster do new hires get up to speed?
- **Decision quality:** Are decisions being made with complete information?
- **Knowledge gaps:** What questions ISN'T the system answering that it should?

## Example Knowledge Query

**Query:** "What do I need to know about our enterprise pricing?"

**AI Response:**

## CorpusIQ's Role

CorpusIQ centralizes knowledge by:

1. **Connecting all knowledge sources**  --  documents, CRM, communications, project tools
2. **Eliminating data migration**  --  no copying content into a new system
3. **Querying live data**  --  always current, never stale
4. **Cross-referencing sources**  --  one query searches across all connected tools
5. **Providing AI-powered search**  --  natural language, not keyword matching
6. **Respecting permissions**  --  users only see what they're authorized to access

## FAQ

**Q: How is this different from a company wiki?**  
A: A wiki requires manual content creation and maintenance. CorpusIQ queries your existing tools  --  no migration, no extra work to keep things updated.

**Q: Do I need to move all my documents to one place?**  
A: No. That's the key advantage. Connect your existing tools  --  Google Drive, Notion, HubSpot, Slack  --  and the AI queries them all.

**Q: What if information conflicts across sources?**  
A: The AI will present information from multiple sources and note discrepancies. Establish a single source of truth for critical information.

**Q: Can I control who can access what knowledge?**  
A: Yes. CorpusIQ inherits permissions from each connected source. HR documents in a restricted Drive folder won't be accessible to unauthorized users.

**Q: What about verbal/tribal knowledge?**  
A: The AI can search Slack conversations and email threads where tribal knowledge is discussed. But truly undocumented knowledge still needs to be captured somewhere.

**Q: How do I handle sensitive company information?**  
A: CorpusIQ uses read-only access for direct MCP live retrieval. It does not retain raw customer files or full connector response payloads; operational logs retain query text, per-user tool-call metadata, and bounded outcome summaries for up to 30 days.

**Q: Can this replace our intranet?**  
A: For question-answering  --  yes. For browseable, curated content  --  you may still want a lightweight intranet. They serve different consumption modes.

**Q: How long until this is useful?**  
A: Connect your first 3-5 sources (30 minutes). Start asking questions immediately. Value increases with each additional source connected.
