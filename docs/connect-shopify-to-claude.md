# How to Connect Shopify to Claude with CorpusIQ MCP

Connecting Shopify to Claude transforms how e-commerce teams interact with their store data. Instead of logging into the Shopify admin, running reports, exporting CSVs, and manually cross-referencing numbers, teams can ask Claude direct questions  --  "What were our top-selling products last month?", "Show me orders that haven't shipped yet", "Compare revenue this quarter to last quarter"  --  and receive accurate, real-time answers backed by live Shopify data.

CorpusIQ makes this connection possible through the Model Context Protocol (MCP), an open standard that gives AI models like Claude secure, read-only access to your business tools. The integration takes under five minutes to set up and requires zero engineering work.

### Why Connect Shopify to Claude?

Shopify stores generate enormous volumes of data  --  orders, customers, products, inventory levels, revenue, discounts, refunds, and more. Most of that data sits unused because accessing it requires navigating dashboards, building reports, or writing SQL. Claude changes that by giving every team member a natural language interface to their Shopify data.

**Key benefits of connecting Shopify to Claude via CorpusIQ:**

- **Instant answers to business questions.** Ask Claude "What was our average order value last week?" instead of building a report.
- **Cross-source correlation.** Combine Shopify revenue data with Google Analytics traffic, Facebook Ads spend, or Klaviyo email metrics in a single Claude conversation.
- **Zero training required.** Anyone who can type a question can query Shopify data through Claude. No SQL, no report builder, no analytics training.
- **Always up to date.** CorpusIQ queries Shopify's live API  --  Claude always returns current data, not stale exports or cached reports.
- **Enterprise security.** OAuth 2.0 authentication with read-only scope. Claude can query your Shopify data but can never modify orders, customers, or products.

### How the Integration Works

CorpusIQ acts as the secure bridge between Claude and Shopify. Here's the architecture:

1. **You connect Shopify once** via OAuth. CorpusIQ stores an encrypted token with read-only permissions to your store's orders, products, customers, and analytics endpoints.
2. **Claude sends a query** when you ask a Shopify-related question  --  for example, "How many orders did we get yesterday?"
3. **CorpusIQ translates** your natural language question into the appropriate Shopify API calls, executes them with your stored credentials, and returns only the relevant data.
4. **Claude synthesizes** the response from the returned data, presenting it in natural language with context and recommendations.

CorpusIQ uses read-only access for direct MCP live retrieval. It does not retain raw customer files or full connector response payloads; operational logs retain query text, per-user tool-call metadata, and bounded outcome summaries for up to 30 days.

### Setup Steps

Setting up the Shopify-to-Claude connection through CorpusIQ takes less than five minutes:

1. **Log into CorpusIQ** and navigate to the Connectors page.
2. **Select Shopify** from the list of available integrations.
3. **Click "Connect Shopify"**  --  you'll be redirected to Shopify's OAuth consent screen.
4. **Authorize the connection.** CorpusIQ requests read-only access to Orders, Products, Customers, and Analytics. Review the scopes and approve.
5. **Return to CorpusIQ.** The connection is immediately active. You can now ask Claude Shopify-related questions.

No API keys to manage. No webhooks to configure. No code to deploy.

### Example Claude Queries After Connecting Shopify

Once connected, Claude can answer an enormous range of Shopify questions. Here are examples across different business functions:

**Sales & Revenue:**
- "What was our total revenue in May, broken down by week?"
- "Show me our top 10 products by revenue this quarter."
- "What's our average order value trend over the last 6 months?"
- "How many orders did we get from returning customers vs. new customers?"

**Operations & Fulfillment:**
- "Which orders haven't been fulfilled yet?"
- "What's our current inventory level for [product]?"
- "Show me products that are at risk of selling out in the next 30 days."
- "List orders with shipping addresses in California that are still unfulfilled."

**Customer Analysis:**
- "Who are our top 20 customers by lifetime spend?"
- "Show me customers who haven't purchased in over 90 days."
- "What's the geographic distribution of our customers?"
- "How many new customers did we acquire last month?"

**Cross-Source Intelligence:**
- "Compare our Shopify revenue to our Facebook Ads spend by week." (requires Facebook Ads connected)
- "What's the conversion rate from Google Analytics sessions to Shopify orders?" (requires GA4 connected)
- "Which Klaviyo email campaigns drove the most Shopify revenue?" (requires Klaviyo connected)

### Security and Permissions

Shopify provider scopes vary by documented operation. The retrieval tools described here are marked read-only:

- **Claude can read** your orders, products, customers, and analytics.
- **Claude can never write**  --  it cannot create, update, or delete anything in your Shopify store.
- **You can revoke access** at any time from Shopify's admin panel or from CorpusIQ's connector management page.
- **Scoped direct-MCP retention.** CorpusIQ uses read-only access for direct MCP live retrieval. It does not retain raw customer files or full connector response payloads; operational logs retain query text, per-user tool-call metadata, and bounded outcome summaries for up to 30 days.
- **Token encryption** ensures your Shopify credentials are protected at rest.

### Comparison: MCP Integration vs. Direct API

| Aspect | CorpusIQ MCP | Direct Shopify API |
|---|---|---|
| Setup time | Under 5 minutes | Hours to days (API key, scopes, code) |
| Technical skill required | None  --  point and click | Developer required |
| Natural language interface | Yes  --  ask Claude in plain English | No  --  requires API calls or code |
| Cross-source correlation | Built-in (combine Shopify + GA4 + Ads + email) | Must build custom ETL pipeline |
| Maintenance | Zero  --  CorpusIQ handles API versioning | Ongoing  --  API changes, deprecations |
| Security model | Read-only OAuth, encrypted at rest | Depends on your implementation |

### Cross-Source Power: Shopify + Other Tools

The real power of connecting Shopify through CorpusIQ's MCP platform is cross-source correlation. Claude can pull data from multiple tools simultaneously and present unified insights:

- **Shopify + Google Analytics:** Understand the full customer journey from traffic source to purchase.
- **Shopify + Facebook/Google Ads:** Calculate true ROAS by comparing ad spend to actual Shopify revenue.
- **Shopify + Klaviyo/Mailchimp:** Attribute email campaign revenue to specific Shopify orders.
- **Shopify + QuickBooks:** Reconcile revenue recorded in Shopify with accounting records in QuickBooks.
- **Shopify + Stripe:** Compare payment processor data with order data for reconciliation.
