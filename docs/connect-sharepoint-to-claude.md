# Connect SharePoint to Claude: Enterprise Documents Meet AI Intelligence

Microsoft SharePoint is the document management backbone for most Fortune 500 companies  --  hosting millions of documents, policies, reports, and presentations. But finding the right document often means navigating complex folder structures, remembering exact file names, or relying on SharePoint's limited search capabilities. Connecting SharePoint to Claude via CorpusIQ's MCP platform transforms your enterprise document library into an AI-queryable knowledge repository.

Ask Claude "Find the Q3 financial close presentation", "What does our data retention policy say about customer PII?", or "Show me all documents related to the [Project Name] initiative" and Claude will search your SharePoint libraries, read relevant documents, and synthesize answers  --  all in seconds.

## Why Connect SharePoint to Claude?

SharePoint stores your organization's most important documents, but accessing the knowledge inside those documents is hard. Claude reads the content, not just the file names, and delivers answers rather than search results.

**Key benefits:**

- **Content-level search, not just metadata.** Claude reads Word documents, PowerPoint presentations, Excel spreadsheets, and PDFs stored in SharePoint, not just file names and titles.
- **Policy and compliance instant answers.** "What's our travel reimbursement policy for international trips?"  --  Claude reads the actual policy document and answers specifically.
- **Cross-document synthesis.** "Compare our Q2 and Q3 strategy presentations"  --  Claude reads both files and delivers a synthesized comparison.
- **Enterprise search democratized.** Any employee can find institutional knowledge without knowing which folder or site it lives in.
- **Meeting preparation.** Before a client meeting, ask Claude to find and summarize all relevant documents stored in SharePoint.
- **Read-only Microsoft Graph integration.** Claude can search and read but can never modify, delete, or upload documents.

## How It Works

1. **Connect Microsoft 365** via OAuth 2.0. CorpusIQ requests read-only access to SharePoint sites and files via Microsoft Graph.
2. **Ask Claude** any question about your enterprise documents.
3. **CorpusIQ searches** SharePoint document libraries and reads relevant files using Microsoft Graph API.
4. **Claude synthesizes** the content into a coherent answer with document citations.

Claude accesses documents that the authenticated user has permission to view. SharePoint permissions are fully respected.

## Setup Steps

1. Navigate to **Connectors** in CorpusIQ.
2. Select **SharePoint** (under Microsoft 365 integrations).
3. Click **"Connect SharePoint"**  --  authorize via Microsoft OAuth.
4. Review permissions: Sites.Read.All, Files.Read.All (read-only access to SharePoint sites and files).
5. Start asking Claude about your enterprise documents.

For organizations with Conditional Access policies, CorpusIQ supports Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD) administrative consent workflows.

## Example Claude Queries

**Document Finding:**
- "Find the latest version of our employee handbook."
- "Show me all documents related to the GDPR compliance project."
- "Find the Q4 board deck and summarize the key financial highlights."
- "Where is our disaster recovery plan document?"

**Policy & Compliance:**
- "What's our data classification policy for confidential documents?"
- "What does our procurement policy say about vendor selection criteria?"
- "Show me all documents that mention 'SOC 2' from the last year."
- "What's our software approval process according to IT policy?"

**Research & Analysis:**
- "Find all competitive analysis documents about [competitor]."
- "Summarize the findings from the last three customer satisfaction surveys."
- "What were the key takeaways from our annual strategy offsite?"

**Cross-Document Intelligence:**
- "Compare our product roadmap from Q1 to what was actually delivered in Q3."
- "Show me all contract templates that include service level agreements."
- "Which departments have updated their business continuity plans this year?"

**Enterprise Operations:**
- "Find all documents owned by [department] that haven't been updated in over a year."
- "What training materials do we have for new sales hires?"
- "Show me all proposals sent to [client name]."

## Enterprise Security

SharePoint contains some of your organization's most sensitive documents. CorpusIQ's integration is built with enterprise security requirements:

- **Read-only OAuth 2.0.** Claude can search and read documents but can never modify, delete, create, or upload files.
- **SharePoint permissions respected.** Claude only sees documents the authenticated user has permission to access.
- **Conditional Access support.** Works with Microsoft Entra ID Conditional Access policies including MFA requirements, device compliance, and location-based restrictions.
- **Scoped direct-MCP retention.** CorpusIQ uses read-only access for direct MCP live retrieval. It does not retain raw customer files or full connector response payloads; operational logs retain query text, per-user tool-call metadata, and bounded outcome summaries for up to 30 days.
- **Audit logging.** All queries are logged in CorpusIQ for compliance visibility.

## Enterprise Deployment Considerations

For large organizations deploying SharePoint integration across teams:

- **Admin consent workflow.** IT administrators can pre-authorize the integration for the entire tenant using Microsoft Entra admin consent.
- **Site collection scoping.** Administrators can configure which SharePoint site collections are accessible.
- **Sensitivity label awareness.** Documents with Microsoft Information Protection sensitivity labels retain their classification metadata.
- **Residency review.** Microsoft 365 remains the authoritative source, while CorpusIQ processing, retained operational classes, and the selected AI-provider plan must be evaluated separately against your residency requirements.

## Comparison: MCP vs. SharePoint API Direct

| Aspect | CorpusIQ MCP | SharePoint API Direct |
|---|---|---|
| Setup | 5-minute OAuth | Developer + Azure AD app registration |
| Natural language | Yes  --  AI reads and understands documents | No  --  API calls return file listings |
| Content understanding | Reads document contents, not just metadata | Requires custom parsing |
| Cross-source | Built-in (SharePoint + Teams + Outlook) | Custom development |
| Non-technical access | Any employee | Developers and SharePoint admins |
| Permission model | Inherits user's SharePoint permissions | Must build custom auth layer |

## FAQ

**Q: What file types can Claude read from SharePoint?**
A: Claude can read Word documents (docx), PowerPoint (pptx), Excel (xlsx), PDFs, and text files stored in SharePoint document libraries.

**Q: Can Claude access SharePoint Online and on-premises SharePoint?**
A: The integration supports SharePoint Online through Microsoft Graph. On-premises SharePoint is not currently supported.

**Q: How does this work with large document libraries (millions of files)?**
A: CorpusIQ uses Microsoft Graph search APIs to efficiently find relevant documents. Claude processes only the most relevant results.

**Q: Can I restrict which SharePoint sites Claude can access?**
A: Yes. Configure site collection scope during OAuth authorization or through Microsoft Entra admin consent.

**Q: Does this work with Teams-shared files?**
A: Yes. Files shared in Microsoft Teams channels are stored in SharePoint and are accessible through the same integration.

**Q: What about documents protected by Azure Information Protection?**
A: Documents with sensitivity labels are accessible, and label metadata is preserved. Claude cannot bypass encryption or rights management protections.
