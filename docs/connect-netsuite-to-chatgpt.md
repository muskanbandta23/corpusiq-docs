# How to Connect NetSuite to ChatGPT with CorpusIQ MCP

Your **NetSuite** account holds critical business data  --  but accessing insights usually means logging in, navigating dashboards, and running manual reports. **Connecting NetSuite to ChatGPT through CorpusIQ MCP** eliminates all that friction. Once connected via a secure OAuth flow, ChatGPT can query your live NetSuite data directly  --  you ask questions in plain English, and get cited answers drawn from your actual account, not outdated exports or screenshots.

Once connected, ChatGPT can query your live NetSuite data  --  financial reports, sales orders, customer records, inventory levels, and project status. You ask questions in plain English and get answers from your live ERP, without touching the NetSuite UI or writing a single line of SuiteScript.

This page covers the architecture, what you can ask, enterprise security, and how MCP compares to direct NetSuite API integration and SuiteScript development.

## FAQ: Common Questions

<details>
<summary><strong>What NetSuite data can ChatGPT access?</strong></summary>

CorpusIQ's NetSuite integration provides access to core ERP objects: sales orders, customers, invoices, inventory, items, financial reports, and project data. ChatGPT can retrieve individual records, list records with filters, and aggregate data across objects. NetSuite connector retrieval is read-only  --  no record creation, editing, or deletion in that source.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What questions can I ask ChatGPT about NetSuite?</strong></summary>

Financial questions: "What's our P&L by subsidiary this month?", "Show me open invoices by aging bucket." Order questions: "What sales orders are scheduled to ship this week?", "Show me orders on hold." Customer questions: "Who are our top 20 customers by revenue YTD?", "Which customers haven't ordered in 90 days?" Inventory questions: "What items are below reorder point?", "Show me inventory by warehouse." Project questions: "What's the status of active projects?", "Which projects are over budget?"
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How does CorpusIQ connect NetSuite to ChatGPT?</strong></summary>

CorpusIQ connects to NetSuite using token-based authentication (TBA)  --  the enterprise-standard method for NetSuite API access. You create an integration record, generate access tokens with read-only permissions, and configure the connection in CorpusIQ. Once connected, the CorpusIQ MCP server exposes NetSuite data as tools that ChatGPT can call. The MCP server handles SuiteTalk/SOAP web services, RESTlet calls, or SuiteQL queries behind the scenes.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Is the connection read-only?</strong></summary>

Yes. The NetSuite integration uses token-based authentication with a role that has read-only permissions. ChatGPT can query records, run saved searches, and retrieve reports. It cannot create, edit, or delete any NetSuite records. The read-only guarantee is enforced by the NetSuite role permissions assigned to the integration.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How does this handle NetSuite's complexity  --  subsidiaries, custom fields, workflows?</strong></summary>

NetSuite is highly customizable, and CorpusIQ's MCP layer is designed to work with that complexity. Custom fields are accessible  --  just reference them in your question. Subsidiary data can be queried per-subsidiary or consolidated. Saved searches can be referenced by name. The MCP layer adapts to your NetSuite configuration, not the other way around.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can ChatGPT combine NetSuite data with other tools?</strong></summary>

Yes  --  cross-source queries are where MCP delivers the most value. "Does this month's NetSuite revenue match our Stripe processing volume?" "Show me NetSuite customers who have open HubSpot deals." "Which NetSuite inventory items have corresponding Shopify listings that are out of stock?" These multi-system questions combine your ERP with your CRM, ecommerce, and payment platforms in one ChatGPT response.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How is this different from NetSuite's built-in reporting?</strong></summary>

NetSuite's reporting tools  --  saved searches, reports, SuiteAnalytics  --  are powerful and essential for formal financial reporting. But they require NetSuite expertise to build and maintain. ChatGPT with MCP provides ad-hoc access: questions that don't fit into a pre-built saved search but matter for daily operations. It's a complement to NetSuite's reporting, not a replacement.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What about SuiteScript  --  do I still need it?</strong></summary>

SuiteScript remains essential for custom business logic, automation, and integrations that require write operations or complex workflows. But for data access  --  the most common reason people write SuiteScript  --  ChatGPT with MCP eliminates the need. Instead of writing a script to pull customer order history, you ask "Show me order history for Customer X" and get the answer immediately.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What permissions do I need in NetSuite?</strong></summary>

You need a NetSuite account with permissions to create an integration record and generate access tokens. The integration role should have read-only access to the record types you want to query. A NetSuite administrator typically handles this setup, which takes about 5-10 minutes one time.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How does this handle multi-subsidiary NetSuite instances?</strong></summary>

CorpusIQ can query across subsidiaries. Specify the subsidiary in your question ("Show me Q2 revenue for the EMEA subsidiary") or ask for consolidated views ("Show me consolidated revenue across all subsidiaries this quarter"). The MCP layer handles subsidiary context transparently.
</details>

## How It Works

1. **Set up NetSuite integration.** In NetSuite, create an integration record, assign a read-only role, and generate consumer key/secret and token ID/secret. This is a one-time setup by your NetSuite admin.

2. **Connect NetSuite to CorpusIQ.** In your CorpusIQ dashboard, click Connections → NetSuite → enter your account ID and token credentials. CorpusIQ validates the connection and confirms available record types.

3. **Connect CorpusIQ to ChatGPT.** Add the CorpusIQ MCP server. ChatGPT discovers available ERP tools for financials, orders, customers, inventory, and more.

4. **Ask ERP questions.** ChatGPT maps your natural language question to the appropriate NetSuite records, executes the query through the MCP server, and returns a cited answer.

5. **Combine with other data.** Ask questions that span NetSuite and your other connected tools  --  CRM, ecommerce, payment platforms, and analytics.

No SuiteScript. No saved searches to build. No CSV exports to analyze in Excel.

## Benefits

**ERP data democratization.** Your sales team, operations team, and executives can get NetSuite answers without NetSuite licenses or training. Natural language is the only interface required.

**Faster operational decisions.** "Do we have enough inventory to fulfill this week's open orders?"  --  a question that could require checking three NetSuite screens  --  becomes one ChatGPT query.

**Cross-department visibility.** "Show me NetSuite customers with open opportunities in HubSpot" combines ERP and CRM data. "Match NetSuite revenue against Stripe payouts" combines ERP and payment data. Only [MCP platforms like CorpusIQ](benefits-of-mcp-for-business.md) provide this cross-source context.

**Reduced SuiteScript dependency.** Every ad-hoc data question that would normally require a custom SuiteScript becomes a ChatGPT conversation. Free your NetSuite developers for higher-value work.

**Enterprise governance.** Read-only by role design with an audit trail. Direct MCP avoids a raw-file/full-payload warehouse; scoped operational logs may persist for up to 30 days.

## Use Cases

### Financial Operations

"Show me this month's P&L by department." "What's our AR aging summary?" "Which vendors have invoices due this week?" "Show me cash position across all bank accounts." Financial operations teams get ERP answers instantly.

### Order Management

"What orders are scheduled to ship today?" "Show me orders on hold and why." "Which customers have backordered items?" "What's our order-to-cash cycle this quarter?" Order management questions become conversational.

### Inventory Planning

"Which items are below reorder point?" "Show me inventory turnover by category." "What's our stock-out risk for the top 50 SKUs?" "Show me slow-moving inventory  --  no sales in 90 days." Inventory planners get live data without running saved searches.

### Customer Operations

"Give me a full view of Customer X  --  orders YTD, open invoices, credit limit, and last order date." "Which customers are approaching their credit limit?" "Show me customers with overdue invoices over 30 days." Customer-facing teams get account 360s in seconds.

### Cross-System Reconciliation

"Does NetSuite revenue match our Stripe processing volume for the month?" "Show me Shopify orders that shipped but aren't invoiced in NetSuite." "Which HubSpot deals closed this month don't have corresponding NetSuite sales orders?" These reconciliation questions catch discrepancies that would otherwise surface at month-end close.

## Security: Enterprise ERP Security

The NetSuite integration's security model is enforced by NetSuite's own permission system:

- **Token-Based Authentication (TBA).** Industry-standard NetSuite API authentication. No passwords, no session cookies.
- **Role-Based Permissions.** The NetSuite role assigned to the integration determines exactly which records and fields are accessible. Create a read-only role and grant only the record types you need.
- **Scoped direct-MCP retention.** CorpusIQ uses read-only access for direct MCP live retrieval. It does not retain raw customer files or full connector response payloads; operational logs retain query text, per-user tool-call metadata, and bounded outcome summaries for up to 30 days.
- **TLS 1.3 Encryption.** All data in transit is encrypted.
- **Audit Trail.** NetSuite's built-in audit trail logs all API access, providing visibility into exactly what data was queried and when.

For enterprises with strict compliance requirements, NetSuite remains the authoritative source. CorpusIQ retrieves permitted ERP records through direct MCP; the retention classes and lifecycles described above still apply.

## Comparison: MCP vs. SuiteScript Development

| Aspect | SuiteScript Development | CorpusIQ MCP |
|--------|------------------------|--------------|
| **Time to first answer** | Days to weeks per script | Minutes from connection |
| **Query flexibility** | Each script answers one specific question | Any question you can ask |
| **Developer dependency** | Requires NetSuite developer for every query | No developer needed |
| **Cross-source** | NetSuite-only | Combine with CRM, ecommerce, payments |
| **Maintenance** | Script updates for NetSuite releases, customizations | CorpusIQ handles updates |
| **Cost** | Developer time + ongoing maintenance | Subscription-based, no dev cost |

SuiteScript is the right tool for custom business logic, automation, and deep NetSuite integration. For data access  --  the most common use case  --  MCP provides the same data with zero code and zero ongoing development.

## Comparison: MCP vs. Direct NetSuite API Integration

| Aspect | Direct API Integration | CorpusIQ MCP |
|--------|----------------------|--------------|
| **Setup** | SuiteTalk/SOAP client, RESTlet configuration, SuiteQL | TBA setup + paste credentials |
| **Query interface** | SuiteQL queries, SOAP web services calls | Natural language |
| **Record navigation** | Must understand NetSuite record types and relationships | Automatic  --  ask in business terms |
| **Error handling** | Complex SOAP fault handling, rate limiting | Built-in |
| **Maintenance** | WSDL updates, API version changes | CorpusIQ handles all updates |

## Setup Guide

1. **NetSuite Setup (one time, by admin).** Create an integration record. Create a read-only role with access to desired record types. Generate TBA tokens (consumer key/secret, token ID/secret).

2. **Sign up** at [corpusiq.io](https://www.corpusiq.io)  --  free 30-day trial.

3. **Connect NetSuite.** Dashboard → Connections → NetSuite → enter account ID and TBA credentials.

4. **Connect ChatGPT.** Add the CorpusIQ MCP server. See our [Quick Start guide](quick-start.md).

5. **Verify.** Ask "How many sales orders are in my NetSuite account?" to confirm the connection.

6. **Explore.** Try "Show me open invoices" or "What's our revenue YTD?"

NetSuite setup takes 5-10 minutes of admin time, one time only. After that, any authorized user can query NetSuite through ChatGPT.
