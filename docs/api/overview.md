# API Overview
CorpusIQ exposes a REST API at `https://mcp2.corpusiq.io/mcp` that allows AI assistants and client applications to query connected business tools, search encrypted archives, and manage user data. All requests are authenticated via Bearer tokens and respond with JSON.

## Base URL

```
https://mcp2.corpusiq.io/mcp
```

All endpoint paths are relative to this base. The API version (`v1`) is part of the URL path. Breaking changes will be released under a new version prefix.

## Endpoints

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `POST` | `/query` | Search across all connected data sources |
| `POST` | `/deep_search` | Search the encrypted archive of past queries and results |

### POST /query

The primary endpoint for querying connected business tools. Accepts a natural-language question and an optional list of connector IDs to scope the search. CorpusIQ translates the query into read-only API calls, retrieves matching records, ranks them semantically, and returns cited results.

Each `/query` request generates a unique `query_id` for tracing and debugging.

### POST /deep_search

Searches the encrypted archive of previously executed queries and their results. This endpoint is useful for retrieving historical answers, auditing past queries, and discovering patterns across previous searches. The archive is encrypted at rest and indexed by embedding vectors.

Unlike `/query`, this endpoint does not make live calls to connected tools  --  it searches only the archive.

## Response Format

All successful responses return HTTP `200` with a JSON body. Errors follow a consistent format with a `type` field identifying the error category and a `message` field with a human-readable description. See [Errors](/docs/api/errors) for the complete error reference.

## Content Type

All request and response bodies use `application/json`. Set the `Content-Type` header to `application/json` on all `POST` requests.

```http
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: What is the CorpusIQ API base URL?**  
A: All CorpusIQ API endpoints are accessed at https://mcp2.corpusiq.io/mcp. The API version (v1) is part of the URL path, and all requests must use HTTPS.

**Q: How do I authenticate with the CorpusIQ API?**  
A: Authentication uses Bearer tokens passed in the Authorization header. Tokens are generated from the CorpusIQ Dashboard and expire after 60 minutes with server-side refresh detection.

**Q: What endpoints does the CorpusIQ API offer?**
A: The API offers POST /query for connected-source search and POST /deep_search for the encrypted query archive.

**Q: What response format does the API use?**  
A: All successful responses return HTTP 200 with a JSON body. Errors follow a consistent format with 'type' and 'message' fields. See the errors reference for complete error codes.

**Q: Is the CorpusIQ API read-only?**  
A: External-source retrieval endpoints are read-only. Connector-management and CorpusIQ control-plane endpoints can change CorpusIQ-owned state and are documented separately.

**Q: How fast are API query responses?**  
A: Most queries return results in 1–5 seconds. Cross-source queries spanning multiple business tools may take slightly longer depending on the number of API calls required.
