# CorpusIQ vs Fivetran  --  MCP Live Query vs ETL Batch Pipelines

## Introduction

Fivetran is the leading managed ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) platform, automating data pipelines from hundreds of sources into cloud data warehouses. CorpusIQ takes a fundamentally different approach: instead of moving data into a warehouse for analysis, it queries data where it lives  --  in real time, through the MCP protocol. Both approaches have legitimate use cases, but for AI-powered business intelligence, the difference in architecture creates dramatically different experiences.

## The Fundamental Difference: Move vs Query

**Fivetran's model:** Extract data from source → transform it → load it into a warehouse → query the warehouse with SQL or BI tools.

**CorpusIQ's model:** AI asks a question → CorpusIQ queries the live source via API → AI presents the answer. Direct MCP does not retain raw customer files or full connector response payloads; optional indexed search is separate.

This architectural difference has cascading implications for cost, speed, freshness, and complexity.

## Quick Comparison

| Feature | CorpusIQ | Fivetran |
|---------|----------|----------|
| **Approach** | Real-time API query (MCP) | Batch ETL pipelines |
| **Data Freshness** | Requested from the provider; freshness follows provider and cache behavior | 5 min to 24 hours (sync frequency) |
| **Source-data replication** | No raw-file/full-payload warehouse | Full replication to warehouse |
| **Infrastructure Required** | None | Data warehouse (Snowflake, BigQuery, etc.) |
| **Setup Complexity** | 2-minute OAuth | Hours to days (connector + warehouse config) |
| **AI Integration** | Native MCP protocol | Indirect (SQL queries via warehouse) |
| **Cost Model** | Per-seat subscription | Per-row (MAR) + warehouse costs |
| **Data Storage** | Direct MCP does not retain raw customer files or full connector response payloads; scoped operational logs may persist up to 30 days | Permanent warehouse copy |
| **Schema Management** | Automatic (API-driven) | Manual schema changes, dbt transforms |
| **Use Case** | AI-powered business questions | Centralized analytics and reporting |

## CorpusIQ's Advantages

### 1. No ETL Warehouse
Every source-data copy creates a governance, security, and freshness burden. CorpusIQ queries HubSpot, Salesforce, QuickBooks, Stripe, and other source APIs live without building a raw-file or full-payload warehouse. Scoped operational logs may persist for up to 30 days.

**Why this matters:** GDPR compliance, SOC 2 audits, and internal data governance all become simpler when you don't maintain additional copies of sensitive business data.

### 2. Real-Time Freshness
Fivetran syncs on a schedule  --  every 5 minutes, every hour, every 24 hours. That means your warehouse data is always slightly stale. CorpusIQ requests current provider data for each query; freshness follows provider behavior and any documented CorpusIQ caching.

**Example:** You just closed a $50K deal in HubSpot. With CorpusIQ, an AI query 30 seconds later reflects that deal. With Fivetran, you wait until the next sync  --  potentially hours.

### 3. No Warehouse Required
Fivetran requires a destination data warehouse: Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift, or Databricks. That's an additional cost, additional maintenance, and additional expertise required. CorpusIQ needs no warehouse  --  it queries sources directly.

### 4. AI-Native Design
CorpusIQ was built for AI. The MCP protocol means any AI assistant can discover, understand, and query your data sources without custom integration code. Fivetran delivers data to a warehouse; you still need BI tools, SQL skills, or separate AI integrations to extract insights.

### 5. Simpler Total Architecture
```
CorpusIQ:  AI → MCP Server → Live API → Source
Fivetran:  Source → Fivetran → Warehouse → BI Tool → Analyst
```

The CorpusIQ path has fewer hops, fewer failure points, and fewer costs.

## Fivetran's Strengths

### 1. Historical Analysis
Fivetran maintains a full historical record in your warehouse. If you need to analyze 5 years of data, compare year-over-year trends from before you connected, or run complex historical queries, a warehouse model is superior.

### 2. Complex Transformations
Fivetran + dbt enables sophisticated data transformations  --  cleaning, joining, aggregating, and enriching data before analysis. CorpusIQ provides raw, live queries; for heavily transformed analytical models, the warehouse approach is more powerful.

### 3. SQL and BI Tool Ecosystem
If your team already uses Tableau, Power BI, Looker, or Metabase, Fivetran fits naturally into that stack. These tools connect to warehouses, not live APIs.

### 4. Data Volume at Scale
For terabyte-scale analytical workloads  --  processing millions of rows per query  --  warehouses are optimized for this. CorpusIQ is designed for business intelligence queries, not massive analytical batch jobs.

### 5. Data Consolidation
If your goal is a "single source of truth" in a centralized warehouse for regulatory or governance reasons, Fivetran's model is the right approach.

## When to Use Each

| Scenario | Best Tool |
|----------|-----------|
| AI assistant needs instant CRM data | **CorpusIQ** |
| Building a company-wide data warehouse | **Fivetran** |
| Executive asks "What's pipeline this quarter?" | **CorpusIQ** |
| Data team needs 5-year trend analysis | **Fivetran + Warehouse** |
| Need cross-source answer in <10 seconds | **CorpusIQ** |
| Powering Tableau/Power BI dashboards | **Fivetran + Warehouse** |
| Compliance favors no raw-file/full-payload warehouse and scoped logs | **CorpusIQ** |
| Running machine learning on unified data | **Fivetran + Warehouse** |

## The Combined Approach

Many organizations use both. Fivetran maintains the data warehouse for formal BI, historical analysis, and ML. CorpusIQ provides the AI-ready layer for instant, natural-language business queries  --  often delivering answers in seconds that would take hours to extract from the warehouse stack.

## Cost Comparison

A typical mid-market company might spend:
- **Fivetran:** $5,000-15,000/month (MAR pricing) + $2,000-10,000/month (warehouse) + $1,000-5,000/month (BI tools) = $8,000-30,000/month total
- **CorpusIQ:** $50-200/seat/month for AI-powered business queries across the same sources

These tools serve different purposes, but for the use case of "ask questions about your business data," CorpusIQ is dramatically more cost-effective.

## FAQ

**Q: Does CorpusIQ store my data like Fivetran does?**  
A: CorpusIQ uses read-only access for direct MCP live retrieval. It does not retain raw customer files or full connector response payloads; operational logs retain query text, per-user tool-call metadata, and bounded outcome summaries for up to 30 days.

**Q: Can CorpusIQ handle the data volumes Fivetran processes?**  
A: CorpusIQ is designed for business intelligence queries, not bulk data extraction. For terabyte-scale analytics, a warehouse approach is more appropriate.

**Q: What if my data source goes down? Does CorpusIQ work offline?**  
A: CorpusIQ requires live source connectivity. Fivetran can serve warehouse data even when sources are unavailable. For mission-critical analytics with unreliable source systems, a warehouse provides resilience.

**Q: Is one replacing the other?**  
A: No. They serve different layers of the data stack. Fivetran moves data for centralized analytics. CorpusIQ enables AI to query data where it lives. Many organizations benefit from both.

**Q: Which is faster for simple business questions?**  
A: CorpusIQ  --  queries complete in 1-5 seconds against live APIs. Fivetran requires the data to already be in the warehouse; if you're asking about data that just changed, the answer isn't available until the next sync.

**Q: Can CorpusIQ replace my data warehouse?**  
A: For AI-powered business questions  --  yes. For formal BI reporting, historical analysis, and ML workloads  --  no. They complement each other.

**Q: How does security compare?**  
A: Both platforms address different enterprise needs. CorpusIQ avoids a raw-file/full-payload warehouse while retaining scoped operational logs. Fivetran provides warehouse-level encryption and access controls for a centralized copy.

**Q: Which is easier to implement?**  
A: CorpusIQ  --  2 minutes to connect, instant AI access. Fivetran  --  hours to days for connector setup, warehouse configuration, schema management, and transformation logic.
