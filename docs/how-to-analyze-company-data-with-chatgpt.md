# How to Analyze Company Data with ChatGPT

## The Problem

Your company data holds the answers to critical business questions  --  but accessing those answers is hard. Sales data is in HubSpot, financials in QuickBooks, marketing in GA4, customer data scattered across tools. To analyze anything, you need to extract data from each system, combine it in Excel, build pivot tables, and hope your formulas are correct. Or you wait for the data team to build a report.

ChatGPT can analyze data brilliantly  --  but only if it can access it. Without a connection to your business systems, ChatGPT is analyzing your copy-pasted spreadsheets, not your live business.

## The Solution

CorpusIQ connects ChatGPT to your live business data through the MCP protocol. Instead of exporting and uploading CSVs, you ask ChatGPT natural-language questions and it queries your live systems  --  delivering real-time analysis formatted exactly how you need it.

## What You'll Need

- CorpusIQ account with connected data sources
- ChatGPT Plus, Team, or Enterprise with MCP support
- Business question you want answered

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Set Up Your CorpusIQ-to-ChatGPT Connection

1. Create a CorpusIQ account at [corpusiq.io](https://corpusiq.io)
2. Connect your data sources: HubSpot, QuickBooks, Stripe, GA4, etc.
3. Copy your MCP Server URL from the CorpusIQ dashboard
4. In ChatGPT: **Settings → Integrations → MCP Servers → Add Server**
5. Paste the URL and save

ChatGPT will discover all your available data tools automatically.

### Step 2: Master Analysis-Focused Questions

ChatGPT analysis works best with questions that specify WHAT to analyze, HOW to break it down, and WHAT comparison to make:

**Sales Analysis:**
```
"Analyze our Q2 sales pipeline: conversion rates by stage, average deal size 
by rep, win/loss reasons, and time-in-stage for stalled deals"
```
Sources: HubSpot

**Financial Analysis:**
```
"Analyze our P&L for the last 6 months: revenue trends by month, expense 
categories as percentage of revenue, and margin trends. Flag any concerning patterns."
```
Sources: QuickBooks

**Marketing Analysis:**
```
"Analyze our marketing performance: channel-level ROAS, customer acquisition 
cost trend, highest and lowest performing campaigns, and attribution overlap 
between Google and Meta"
```
Sources: Google Ads, Meta Ads, GA4

**Customer Analysis:**
```
"Analyze our customer base: revenue concentration (top 10 customers), churn 
rate by cohort, expansion revenue vs new logo revenue, and average customer lifetime"
```
Sources: HubSpot, Stripe, QuickBooks

### Step 3: Request Specific Analytical Methods

Tell ChatGPT how you want the analysis performed:

| Analysis Type | How to Ask |
|--------------|------------|
| **Trend** | "Show me month-over-month trends for..." |
| **Comparison** | "Compare Q2 to Q1 for..." |
| **Segmentation** | "Break down... by customer size / industry / region" |
| **Cohort** | "Show me retention by monthly cohort for..." |
| **Funnel** | "Analyze conversion rates through each stage of..." |
| **Variance** | "Identify the biggest variances between plan and actual for..." |

### Step 4: Request Visualizations

ChatGPT can generate charts from your live data:

```
"Create a bar chart showing monthly revenue for the last 12 months, 
with a trend line and labels for the top 3 months"
```

```
"Generate a pie chart of revenue by product line for Q2, with 
percentage labels"
```

```
"Build a funnel visualization of our sales pipeline stages 
with conversion rates between each stage"
```

### Step 5: Iterate for Deeper Insights

Good analysis is iterative. Start broad, then drill down:

1. **"Analyze our Q2 revenue"** → Overview
2. **"Break that down by product line"** → Segmentation
3. **"Which product line grew fastest?"** → Identify winners
4. **"Show me the top 5 customers for that product"** → Drill down
5. **"Are any of those customers at risk based on recent activity?"** → Cross-reference

## Example Analysis

**Query:** "Analyze our sales performance and identify our biggest problems."

**ChatGPT Response (powered by CorpusIQ):**
```
SALES PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS  --  Q2 2026

OVERALL: $1,580,000 closed (91 deals, 38% win rate). Target: $1,500,000. 
Status: ABOVE TARGET (+5.3%).

WHAT'S WORKING:
• Enterprise segment: 62% win rate, avg deal $45,000
• Referral-sourced deals: 71% win rate (highest quality source)
• Rep Sarah Chen: $425,000 closed (27% of total, highest producer)

IDENTIFIED PROBLEMS:

1. DEAL VELOCITY ISSUE
• 7 deals worth $245,000 stuck in Negotiation >30 days
• Root cause appears to be legal review bottlenecks (from deal notes)
• Revenue at risk: $245,000 (15.5% of pipeline)

2. WIN RATE DECLINE IN SMB SEGMENT
• SMB win rate dropped from 28% (Q1) to 21% (Q2)
• Average sales cycle increased from 18 to 27 days
• Possible competitive pressure  --  worth investigating

3. PIPELINE COVERAGE GAP IN AUGUST
• July pipeline: $1.2M (healthy)
• August pipeline: $580K (below $750K target)
• Need accelerated prospecting for August close dates

4. REP PERFORMANCE VARIANCE
• Top rep (Sarah): $425K | Bottom rep (David): $295K
• Gap is larger than typical  --  David's win rate dropped 12pp from Q1
• Recommend: review David's pipeline quality and provide coaching

RECOMMENDED ACTIONS:
1. Prioritize legal review for the 7 stalled deals
2. Investigate SMB competitive landscape
3. Launch August pipeline acceleration campaign
4. Coaching session with David on deal qualification
```

## FAQ

**Q: Can ChatGPT really analyze data as well as a human analyst?**  
A: For most business analysis tasks  --  trends, comparisons, segmentation, anomaly detection  --  yes. For highly specialized statistical modeling, a human analyst may still be needed.

**Q: How do I know the analysis is accurate?**  
A: ChatGPT queries live data through CorpusIQ  --  the numbers are exact. The interpretation (identifying problems, suggesting actions) is AI-generated and should be reviewed.

**Q: Can it handle sensitive financial data?**  
A: CorpusIQ uses read-only access for direct MCP live retrieval. It does not retain raw customer files or full connector response payloads; operational logs retain query text, per-user tool-call metadata, and bounded outcome summaries for up to 30 days.

**Q: What's the difference between this and uploading a CSV to ChatGPT?**  
A: CSV uploads are static  --  the data is already old. CorpusIQ provides live data that reflects your current business state. No exports, no uploads.

**Q: Can I analyze data from multiple companies or subsidiaries?**  
A: Yes. Connect multiple instances of the same tool (e.g., two HubSpot accounts) to analyze across entities.

**Q: How detailed can the analysis get?**  
A: As detailed as your data allows. If your CRM tracks deal-level activities, ChatGPT can analyze activity patterns. If it only tracks stages, analysis is limited to stage-level insights.

**Q: Can I save analyses for future reference?**  
A: Copy ChatGPT's responses to a document or note. Each query runs fresh against live data.
