# How to Connect QuickBooks to ChatGPT with CorpusIQ MCP

Your **QuickBooks** account holds critical business data  --  but accessing insights usually means logging in, navigating dashboards, and running manual reports. **Connecting QuickBooks to ChatGPT through CorpusIQ MCP** eliminates all that friction. Once connected via a secure OAuth flow, ChatGPT can query your live QuickBooks data directly  --  you ask questions in plain English, and get cited answers drawn from your actual account, not outdated exports or screenshots.

Once connected, ChatGPT can query your live QuickBooks data. Ask about your Profit and Loss, balance sheet, overdue invoices, accounts receivable aging, and customer balances  --  all in plain English, all from live data.

This page covers the connection, what you can ask, security considerations, setup steps, and why MCP is fundamentally different from direct QuickBooks API integration.

## FAQ: Common Questions

<details>
<summary><strong>What financial questions can I ask ChatGPT about QuickBooks?</strong></summary>

Virtually any question about your financials. Examples: "What was our P&L last quarter?", "Show me overdue invoices over $5,000 sorted by days overdue", "How much cash is on the balance sheet right now?", "Who are our top 10 customers by outstanding balance?", "What did we spend on contractors this fiscal year?", "Show me our revenue trend month by month for the last 12 months", "What's our accounts receivable aging look like?", "Which vendors have the highest outstanding bills?"
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How does the connection work?</strong></summary>

CorpusIQ connects to your QuickBooks Online company file via OAuth 2.0. You authorize read-only access once, then connect the CorpusIQ MCP server to ChatGPT. ChatGPT discovers the available financial tools automatically and calls them when you ask a question. Direct MCP queries live QuickBooks data without a raw-file/full-payload warehouse; scoped operational logs may persist for up to 30 days.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Is this read-only? Can ChatGPT modify my books?</strong></summary>

The QuickBooks retrieval tools documented here are marked read-only and cover reports, invoices, payments, customers, vendors, and accounts. Provider scopes are those required by Intuit for the documented operations; write-capable tools, when present, are separately named and annotated.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Does this work with QuickBooks Desktop?</strong></summary>

No. CorpusIQ connects to QuickBooks Online (QBO) only. QuickBooks Desktop does not expose the API endpoints required for MCP integration. If you're on QuickBooks Desktop, consider migrating to QuickBooks Online  --  or see our [QuickBooks connector reference](connect-quickbooks-to-chatgpt.md) for the full compatibility list.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How do my accountant and I share access?</strong></summary>

Multiple users can connect the same QuickBooks company file through their own CorpusIQ accounts. Each user's MCP connection is independent. Your accountant connects through their CorpusIQ account, you connect through yours. Both can ask ChatGPT questions  --  and both connections are read-only, so there's no risk of conflicting changes.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What level of QuickBooks access do I need?</strong></summary>

You need QuickBooks Online with Admin or Company Admin access to authorize the OAuth connection. Once authorized, any user with a CorpusIQ account connected to that authorization can query the data through ChatGPT. Accountants connecting on behalf of a client should ensure they have the appropriate permission level in QBO.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How quickly does data update?</strong></summary>

CorpusIQ queries QuickBooks through the live API. When you ask a question, the answer reflects the current state of your QuickBooks file. If someone recorded a payment 30 seconds ago, your next ChatGPT question will see it. There is no caching delay, no overnight refresh, no ETL lag.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I compare QuickBooks data with data from other tools?</strong></summary>

Yes  --  this is one of MCP's strongest capabilities. "Does our Shopify revenue match what QuickBooks shows for the same period?" queries both platforms simultaneously. "Show me Stripe payouts that haven't been reconciled in QuickBooks" is a single cross-source question. See our [Benefits of MCP for Business](benefits-of-mcp-for-business.md) for more on cross-source analytics.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How does this handle multi-currency?</strong></summary>

CorpusIQ retrieves data in your QuickBooks home currency by default. If your QuickBooks file supports multi-currency, amounts are reported in the currency of the transaction with the home currency equivalent. Specify the currency in your question if you need a specific view.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What is CorpusIQ's SOC 2 posture?</strong></summary>

CorpusIQ maintains a SOC 2 aligned posture; formal SOC 2 certification is not claimed. Data is encrypted in transit (TLS 1.3) and OAuth 2.0 is used throughout. Direct MCP does not retain raw customer files or full connector response payloads; scoped operational logs may persist for up to 30 days. See our [security documentation](../security/) for details.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What about accrual vs. cash basis reporting?</strong></summary>

CorpusIQ uses your QuickBooks default reporting basis. If your company is set to accrual, answers reflect accrual accounting. If cash basis, answers reflect cash basis. You can specify the reporting basis in your question: "Show me the P&L on a cash basis for Q2."
</details>

## How It Works

The architecture is clean and secure:

1. **Connect QuickBooks to CorpusIQ.** Click Connections → QuickBooks in your CorpusIQ dashboard. Sign into Intuit, select your company file, and review and approve the provider scopes. Takes 2 minutes.

2. **Connect CorpusIQ to ChatGPT.** Add the CorpusIQ MCP server as a connected app in ChatGPT. The server advertises its available financial tools to ChatGPT automatically.

3. **Ask financial questions.** ChatGPT receives your question, determines it needs QuickBooks data, calls the appropriate MCP tool (P&L report, invoice lookup, balance sheet, etc.), and returns a cited answer.

4. **Drill down with follow-ups.** "Now show me just the Q2 portion of that" or "Break that down by customer"  --  ChatGPT maintains context across turns.

The key architectural insight: each question retrieves the required QuickBooks records from Intuit and sends the result through CorpusIQ to your chosen AI client. CorpusIQ does not retain raw customer files or full connector response payloads; operational logs follow the published retention policy.

## Benefits of Connecting QuickBooks to ChatGPT

**Financial visibility without financial software expertise.** Your operations lead, sales manager, or CEO can ask about cash position, overdue invoices, and revenue trends without knowing how to navigate QuickBooks reports. The interface is natural language  --  the same interface they already use every day with ChatGPT.

**Faster financial close.** Instead of running a dozen reports at month-end and manually compiling them, ask ChatGPT: "Give me the month-end snapshot  --  P&L, balance sheet, AR aging, and top 5 overdue invoices." One question replaces 20 minutes of report generation.

**Real-time cash management.** Daily cash position questions become trivial. "What's our current cash across all bank accounts?" "Show me payments received today." No login required, just ask ChatGPT.

**Cross-source reconciliation.** Match QuickBooks data against Stripe payouts, Shopify orders, and bank transactions. The [multi-source MCP architecture](benefits-of-mcp-for-business.md) makes reconciliation a conversational task instead of a spreadsheet marathon.

**Audit-ready provenance.** Every answer includes a source citation  --  which connector, which query, and when. If your auditor asks where a number came from, you have a traceable path back to the source.

## Use Cases

### Daily Cash Monitoring

Start every morning by asking ChatGPT: "What's our cash position today?" "Any payments received overnight?" "Show me bills due this week." Five minutes replaces logging into QuickBooks, navigating to the dashboard, and checking multiple views.

### Accounts Receivable Management

"Show me all overdue invoices sorted by days overdue, with customer contact info." "Which customers are over 60 days past due?" "What's our total AR by age bucket?" Collections teams get a prioritized worklist in seconds.

### Month-End Close

"Give me the full month-end package  --  P&L, balance sheet, AR aging, AP aging." ChatGPT compiles all the reports in one response. Follow up with "What are the biggest expense variances from last month?" without switching contexts.

### Vendor and Expense Analysis

"What did we spend with Vendor X this year?" "Show me our top 10 expenses by category." "Which vendors have the highest outstanding bills?" Procurement and AP teams get instant visibility.

### Financial Planning

"Show me revenue by month for the last 2 years." "What's our average monthly burn rate?" "Project Q3 revenue based on year-to-date trends." ChatGPT can perform the calculations on the live data it retrieves.

## Security: Read-Only by Design

CorpusIQ publishes operation-level permissions for QuickBooks:

- **Provider scopes:** CorpusIQ requests the Intuit scopes required for documented operations.
- **MCP tools:** Retrieval and write-capable operations are separately named and safety-annotated.
- **Scoped direct-MCP retention.** QuickBooks retrieval tools are marked read-only. It does not retain raw customer files or full connector response payloads; operational logs retain query text, per-user tool-call metadata, and bounded outcome summaries for up to 30 days.
- **Encrypted in Transit:** All data between QuickBooks, CorpusIQ, and ChatGPT is encrypted via TLS 1.3.

For organizations in regulated industries, this read-only architecture eliminates the most common financial data risk: unintended modification. Even a misdirected query cannot change your books.

## Comparison: MCP vs. Direct QuickBooks API Integration

| Aspect | Direct API Integration | CorpusIQ MCP |
|--------|----------------------|--------------|
| **Setup time** | Days to weeks of Intuit API development | 2 minutes |
| **Auth management** | OAuth token rotation, refresh logic, error handling | Handled by CorpusIQ |
| **Query interface** | REST endpoints, JSON parsing, data modeling | Natural language |
| **Multi-entity support** | Must implement entity switching logic per code path | Automatic  --  just ask about the right company |
| **Cross-source queries** | Build separate integrations for Stripe, Shopify, etc. | One question across all connected tools |
| **Maintenance** | Intuit API deprecation, version migration | CorpusIQ handles all API updates |
| **Error handling** | Must code for rate limits, pagination, data types | Built-in |

The direct API approach is appropriate when you need write operations  --  creating invoices programmatically, automating payment recording, or building custom financial workflows. For financial Q&A, reporting, and monitoring, MCP is dramatically simpler and safer.

## Setup Guide

1. **Sign up** at [corpusiq.io](https://www.corpusiq.io)  --  free 30-day trial with full QuickBooks access.
