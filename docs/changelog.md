# Changelog

All notable changes to the CorpusIQ API are documented here. This project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

---

## August 2026  --  Distribution Milestones

### Claude Custom Connector Support

Claude users can add the public CorpusIQ MCP endpoint through Claude's custom connector flow. CorpusIQ is not yet listed in Anthropic's Connector Directory, so setup currently requires entering the endpoint manually.

### MCP Auth Refresh (silent, no re-login)

The MCP server now mints a 30-day refresh token after a successful device or Google OAuth reconnect. Token refresh is silent: expired access tokens rotate automatically without user interaction.

---

## v1.0  --  March 2026

### Initial API Release

The first public release of the CorpusIQ API, providing programmatic access to the platform's core query, archive search, and data management capabilities.

### New Endpoints

- **`POST /v1/query`**  --  Search across all connected business tools with natural-language queries. Supports connector scoping via the `connectors` parameter and returns semantically ranked, cited results from each matching connector.

- **`POST /v1/deep_search`**  --  Search the encrypted archive of previously executed queries and their results. Supports date-range filtering and returns similarity-scored matches.


### Authentication

- Bearer token authentication via `Authorization` header
- 60-minute token expiry with server-side refresh detection
- Token issuance through the CorpusIQ Dashboard and ChatGPT Actions
- Dashboard disconnect commits inactive CorpusIQ connection state; provider-side authorization remains governed by the provider

### OpenAPI Specification

- Complete OpenAPI 3.0.3 spec published at `https://mcp2.corpusiq.io/mcp`
- Importable into Postman, Insomnia, and Swagger UI
- Interactive documentation at `https://mcp2.corpusiq.io/mcp`


### Rate Limiting

- Per-endpoint rate limits with minute and daily windows
- Rate limit headers on every response for self-monitoring
- `retry_after_seconds` field in `429` responses

### Security

- Operation-level safety annotations distinguish external-source retrieval from write-capable management/control-plane tools
- Scoped data handling: direct MCP live retrieval plus optional indexed-search embeddings
- TLS 1.3 for all API traffic
- AES-256-GCM encryption at rest
- SOC 2 Type II compliance program initiated

### Connectors

- 40+ native connectors spanning email, calendar, file storage, analytics, CRM, ecommerce, marketing, financial, social media, and databases
- Provider scopes match each connector's documented operations
- Direct database connectors for PostgreSQL, SQL Server, MySQL, Azure Cosmos DB, and MongoDB

### Documentation

- Published [CorpusIQ Documentation](/docs/) covering API reference, authentication, rate limits, security, and quick start
- Connector catalog with descriptions for all supported integrations
- Code examples in cURL, JavaScript, and Python for all endpoints
