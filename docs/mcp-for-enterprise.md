# MCP for Enterprise: How to Connect Your Business Data to AI

**Enterprise teams need fast, accurate answers from their business data**  --  but traditional BI tools and manual reporting create bottlenecks that slow decision-making. The Model Context Protocol (MCP) gives enterprise professionals direct AI-powered access to live data from QuickBooks, Salesforce, HubSpot, Shopify, and 25+ other platforms through natural language queries. No more waiting on data teams for reports  --  just connect your tools and ask questions in plain English.

## Enterprise-Grade Architecture

CorpusIQ's enterprise deployment model is built for organizations with thousands of employees, dozens of departments, and complex data access requirements:

**Dedicated infrastructure.** Enterprise customers can deploy CorpusIQ on dedicated cloud infrastructure, ensuring resource isolation from other customers. This supports predictable performance and simplifies compliance auditing.

**High availability.** The MCP server layer runs in an active-active configuration across multiple availability zones. If one zone experiences issues, traffic automatically routes to healthy instances with no downtime.

**Horizontal scaling.** As query volume grows, additional MCP server instances are added automatically. The stateless architecture means scaling is purely a matter of adding compute  --  no data migration, no schema changes, no downtime.

**Regional deployment planning.** Enterprise customers can request a deployment region. Storage, network paths, source-provider processing, the selected AI client, logs, and backups must be validated together before making a residency commitment.

## Single Sign-On and Identity Management

Enterprise security starts with identity. CorpusIQ supports:

**SAML 2.0 and OpenID Connect.** Integrate with your existing identity provider  --  Okta, Azure AD, Ping Identity, OneLogin, or any SAML/OIDC-compatible IdP. Employees use their corporate credentials to access CorpusIQ.

**Role-based access control (RBAC).** Define roles with specific permissions  --  who can connect data sources, who can query which platforms, who can view audit logs. Map these roles to your existing directory groups.

**Just-in-time provisioning.** When a new employee joins a directory group with CorpusIQ access, they're automatically provisioned. When they leave the group or the organization, access is automatically revoked.

**Multi-factor authentication enforcement.** Require MFA for all CorpusIQ access, integrated with your existing MFA infrastructure.

**Session management.** Configure session timeouts, IP-based access restrictions, and concurrent session limits according to your security policy.

## Department-Level Data Governance

Large organizations don't have one set of data  --  they have many, each owned by different departments with different access requirements. CorpusIQ supports:

**Department-scoped connections.** The marketing department connects Meta Ads and Google Analytics. The finance department connects QuickBooks and Stripe. The sales department connects Salesforce. Each department manages its own connections, and users in one department cannot access another department's data sources unless explicitly authorized.

**Cross-department querying with governance.** When a question requires data from multiple departments  --  like comparing marketing spend to revenue  --  CorpusIQ enforces access controls. A user can only query data sources they're authorized to access. The cross-source query respects all departmental boundaries.

**Data source approval workflow.** Enterprise administrators can require approval before new data sources are connected. When a department head wants to connect a new platform, the request routes to the security team for review before OAuth tokens are issued.

**Usage analytics by department.** Understand which departments are using the platform, which data sources they're querying most frequently, and where additional training or connectors might be valuable.

## Compliance and Audit Readiness

Enterprise compliance requirements are non-negotiable. CorpusIQ supports:

**SOC 2 posture.** CorpusIQ maintains a SOC 2 aligned security posture; formal SOC 2 Type II certification is not claimed.

**Comprehensive audit logging.** Every tool call is logged with full context: who made the query, which data source was accessed, what parameters were used, when it happened, and what the result was. Audit logs are immutable and retained according to the customer's compliance requirements.

**Audit log export.** Export audit logs to your SIEM (Splunk, Sumo Logic, Datadog) or compliance management platform for integration with existing monitoring and alerting infrastructure.

**Data residency.** Region-specific deployment options can support an enterprise residency design. Customers must still validate CorpusIQ storage, network paths, selected AI-provider processing, backups, and operational controls against their requirements; a deployment region alone is not a residency guarantee.

**Custom data retention policies.** Configure how long audit logs and metadata are retained according to your internal policies and regulatory requirements.

**GDPR compliance.** Direct MCP does not retain raw customer files or full connector response payloads. Operational query logs are retained for up to 30 days, while optional indexed search and compliance records have separate lifecycles. This scoped model supports data minimization without pretending the service retains nothing.

## Integration with Enterprise Architecture

CorpusIQ integrates with the systems enterprises already use:

**API gateway integration.** Route CorpusIQ traffic through your existing API gateway (Apigee, Kong, AWS API Gateway) for consistent authentication, rate limiting, and monitoring.

**SIEM integration.** Stream audit logs to your security information and event management system for centralized monitoring and alerting.

**Data catalog integration.** CorpusIQ's tool discovery mechanism complements enterprise data catalogs (Alation, Collibra, Atlan). MCP provides the real-time query layer while the data catalog provides governance and discovery of broader data assets.

**Custom connector development.** For enterprises with proprietary systems, CorpusIQ supports building custom MCP connectors that expose internal platforms through the same protocol. These custom connectors integrate seamlessly with the standard connector library.

## Multi-Department Deployment Strategy

Rolling out MCP across a large enterprise requires a phased approach:

**Phase 1: Pilot department.** Start with one department  --  typically finance or sales operations  --  that has clearly defined data sources and high-value use cases. Connect 3-5 platforms, train power users, and measure impact.

**Phase 2: Expand to adjacent departments.** Based on pilot learnings, expand to departments that share data sources with the pilot group. Marketing might join if they share analytics platforms. Customer success might join if they share CRM access.

**Phase 3: Enterprise-wide deployment.** With proven value and refined governance policies, open access to all departments. At this stage, the platform is managing dozens of data source connections across multiple departments with clear access boundaries.

**Phase 4: Custom integration.** Build custom MCP connectors for proprietary systems, integrate with enterprise data catalogs, and embed MCP queries into internal applications through the MCP API.

## Enterprise Use Cases

**Executive dashboards.** The CEO asks "what's our global revenue this quarter compared to forecast?"  --  a question that spans ERP, CRM, and financial planning systems across multiple regions. MCP queries all relevant sources and returns a consolidated answer.

**Cross-functional analytics.** The revenue operations team asks "how does marketing spend correlate with sales pipeline generation and closed revenue?"  --  a question spanning marketing platforms, CRM, and financial systems. MCP handles the cross-source orchestration.

**Compliance monitoring.** The compliance team asks "show me all financial transactions over $50,000 this quarter with their associated approval records." MCP queries the ERP and approval systems, returning an audit-ready report.

**M&A integration.** When an enterprise acquires a company, integrating their systems into the corporate reporting structure typically takes months. With MCP, the acquired company's platforms can be connected immediately, providing visibility while the long-term integration proceeds.

**Self-service analytics.** Business analysts across departments ask ad-hoc questions without filing tickets with the data engineering team. The data team focuses on infrastructure while business users self-serve through natural language queries.
