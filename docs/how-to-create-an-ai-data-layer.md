# How to Create an AI Data Layer

## The Problem

Your organization has data everywhere  --  CRM, accounting, analytics, payments, email, documents, databases. But your AI assistants can't access any of it. Building custom integrations for each source is expensive and fragile. Data warehousing solves the analytics problem but not the AI accessibility problem. You need a layer that makes ALL business data available to AI  --  seamlessly, securely, and in real time.

That layer is the **AI Data Layer**  --  and CorpusIQ makes it achievable in hours, not months.

## What Is an AI Data Layer?

An AI data layer is an abstraction that sits between your business systems and your AI applications. Instead of each AI application needing custom code to access each data source, the layer provides a standardized protocol (MCP) that any AI can use to discover and query any connected source.

```

```

## What You'll Need

- CorpusIQ account
- MCP-compatible AI assistant(s)
- Business data sources to connect
- Understanding of your data access patterns

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Audit Your Data Sources

List every system that contains business data your AI should access:

| Category | Common Sources | Data Available |
|----------|---------------|----------------|
| **CRM** | HubSpot, Salesforce, Close | Contacts, deals, companies, activities |
| **Accounting** | QuickBooks, Xero | Revenue, expenses, invoices, P&L |
| **Payments** | Stripe | Charges, customers, refunds, payouts |
| **Analytics** | GA4, PostHog | Traffic, conversions, user behavior |
| **Marketing** | Google Ads, Meta Ads, Klaviyo | Spend, impressions, clicks, conversions |
| **Communication** | Gmail, Outlook, Slack | Messages, threads, channels |
| **Documents** | Google Drive, OneDrive, Notion | Files, spreadsheets, documentation |
| **Databases** | PostgreSQL, MSSQL, MongoDB | Custom application data |

### Step 2: Prioritize by Value

Not all sources need to be connected on day one. Prioritize by business impact:

**Tier 1  --  Connect immediately:**
- CRM (most business questions involve customers)
- Accounting (revenue is the universal metric)
- Payments (cash position and transaction data)

**Tier 2  --  Connect within week 1:**
- Analytics (marketing and product questions)
- Advertising (ROI and attribution questions)
- Email (communication context)

**Tier 3  --  Connect as needed:**
- Database (custom application data)
- Documents (policies, procedures)
- Project management (Monday.com, etc.)

### Step 3: Connect Through CorpusIQ

For each prioritized source:

1. Go to your CorpusIQ dashboard → **Add Connector**
2. Select the source and authenticate via OAuth
3. Verify the connection by asking a test question in your AI assistant
4. Repeat until all Tier 1 and Tier 2 sources are connected

### Step 4: Define Your Access Patterns

Document the types of questions each team will ask:

**Executive Team:**
- "What's our quarterly revenue, pipeline, and burn rate?"
- "Show me customer acquisition cost by channel"
- Sources: QuickBooks, HubSpot, Stripe, GA4, Google Ads

**Sales Team:**
- "Which deals are at risk of slipping?"
- "Show me my accounts with no recent activity"
- Sources: HubSpot, Gmail, Slack

**Marketing Team:**
- "Which campaigns have the highest ROAS?"
- "How does email performance correlate with web traffic?"
- Sources: GA4, Google Ads, Meta Ads, Klaviyo

**Customer Success:**
- "Which customers have open support tickets?"
- "Show me accounts with declining usage"
- Sources: HubSpot, Stripe, GA4

### Step 5: Govern and Scale

As your AI data layer matures:

1. **Document connected sources** and what data each provides
2. **Create a query library** of proven high-value questions
3. **Monitor usage** to identify which sources and questions deliver the most value
4. **Add new sources** as your tool stack evolves
5. **Train new users** on how to ask effective questions

## Architecture Best Practices

### 1. Read-Only by Default
Your AI data layer should be read-only. AI should analyze and report on data, not modify it. CorpusIQ enforces this at the connector level.

### 2. Source-of-Truth Awareness
Different systems may have different versions of the same metric. Document which source is authoritative for which metric. Example: "Revenue for financial reporting comes from QuickBooks, not Stripe."

### 3. Permission Propagation
Your AI data layer should respect source permissions. If a user can't access certain HubSpot deals, the AI shouldn't see them either. CorpusIQ inherits permissions from connected sources.

### 4. Avoid a Raw-Data Warehouse for Direct Queries
The direct-query path can call live sources without a raw-file/full-payload warehouse. Scoped operational logs still apply, and optional indexed search has a separate lifecycle.

## CorpusIQ's Role

CorpusIQ IS the AI data layer. It provides:

1. **Standardized protocol (MCP)**  --  any AI can connect, discover, and query
2. **40+ pre-built connectors**  --  CRM, accounting, analytics, payments, comms, files
3. **Zero infrastructure**  --  fully managed, no servers to run
4. **Real-time queries**  --  no ETL, no warehouse, no batch windows
5. **Cross-source orchestration**  --  one question, multiple sources, unified answer
6. **Scoped direct-MCP retention.** CorpusIQ uses read-only access for direct MCP live retrieval. It does not retain raw customer files or full connector response payloads; operational logs retain query text, per-user tool-call metadata, and bounded outcome summaries for up to 30 days.

## FAQ

**Q: How is this different from a data warehouse?**  
A: A data warehouse stores copies for analytics. A direct-query AI data layer uses live, read-only access without a raw-file/full-payload warehouse; scoped operational logs may still be retained.

**Q: Do I still need a data warehouse?**  
A: For formal BI reporting, historical analysis, and ML  --  yes. For AI-powered business queries  --  the AI data layer may be sufficient.

**Q: Can I add custom data sources?**  
A: CorpusIQ supports custom database connections (PostgreSQL, MSSQL, MongoDB). For unsupported APIs, request a new connector or use the database connector as a bridge.

**Q: How do I handle data that changes frequently?**  
A: The AI data layer queries live sources, so changes are reflected immediately. No sync lag, no stale data.

**Q: Is this a replacement for API integrations?**  
A: For AI access to data  --  yes. For application-to-application integration  --  no. Zapier or custom APIs are still needed for automated workflows.

**Q: How does this work with multiple AI assistants?**  
A: The same CorpusIQ MCP server works with ChatGPT, Claude, and custom MCP clients simultaneously. One data layer, many AI consumers.

**Q: What about data privacy regulations?**  
A: Direct MCP retrieves required records from the source and sends the result through CorpusIQ to the requesting AI client. CorpusIQ does not retain raw customer files or full connector response payloads; operational logs are retained for up to 30 days. This avoids a replicated warehouse while keeping the actual processing path and retention schedule explicit.
