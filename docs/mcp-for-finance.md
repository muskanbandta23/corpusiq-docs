# MCP for Finance: How to Connect Your Business Data to AI

**Finance teams need fast, accurate answers from their business data**  --  but traditional BI tools and manual reporting create bottlenecks that slow decision-making. The Model Context Protocol (MCP) gives finance professionals direct AI-powered access to live data from QuickBooks, Salesforce, HubSpot, Shopify, and 25+ other platforms through natural language queries. No more waiting on data teams for reports  --  just connect your tools and ask questions in plain English.

## The Finance Data Fragmentation Problem

A corporate finance team typically interacts with:
- **Accounting systems** (QuickBooks, NetSuite, Sage Intacct)
- **Payment processors** (Stripe, Braintree, Adyen)
- **Banking platforms** (multiple bank portals for cash positions)
- **ERP systems** (SAP, Oracle, Microsoft Dynamics)
- **FP&A tools** (Adaptive Insights, Anaplan, Vena)
- **Equity management** (Carta, Shareworks)
- **Expense management** (Expensify, Ramp, Brex)
- **Spreadsheets** (the universal finance tool, but not a system of record)

Each system holds critical financial data, but pulling it all together for a complete financial picture requires manual data aggregation  --  exporting reports from each system and combining them in spreadsheets. This process is slow, error-prone, and consumes analyst time that should be spent on analysis rather than data gathering.

MCP eliminates the aggregation step. Connect your financial systems once, and ask questions that span all of them. "What's our consolidated cash position across all bank accounts and payment processors?" queries every connected financial platform and returns a unified answer.

## Portfolio and Investment Tracking

For organizations managing investments or multiple revenue streams:

**Investment performance.** "What's the total return on our investment portfolio this quarter, broken down by asset class?" Connect portfolio management systems for real-time performance data.

**Revenue by entity.** "Show me revenue by business unit for the current fiscal year, with comparisons to budget and prior year." Multi-entity financial consolidation through natural language.

**Cash position monitoring.** "What's our total available cash across all accounts, and what's the projected cash balance 30 days out based on scheduled receivables and payables?" Forward-looking liquidity analysis.

**Risk exposure.** "What's our exposure to any single customer, vendor, or market segment?" Concentration risk analysis from your financial data.

**FX exposure.** For global businesses: "What's our unrealized FX gain or loss on outstanding foreign currency receivables and payables?"

## Expense Management

Expense analysis that currently takes hours of spreadsheet work:

**Expense categorization.** "What were our top 10 expense categories last month, and how do they compare to the monthly average?" Category-level analysis without running individual reports.

**Vendor spend analysis.** "Who are our top 20 vendors by spend this year, and how has that ranking changed from last year?" Identify vendor concentration and renegotiation opportunities.

**Policy compliance.** "Are there any expenses this month that exceed policy limits or lack required approvals?" Automated compliance checking against defined expense policies.

**Trend identification.** "Which expense categories are growing fastest and should we investigate?" Anomaly detection in spending patterns.

**Department-level analysis.** "Compare actual vs budget spending by department for Q2. Where are the largest variances?" Instant variance reporting.

**Travel and entertainment.** "What was our total T&E spend this quarter? Break it down by department and compare to the same quarter last year."

## Financial Reporting

Transform recurring financial reporting from manual to automated:

**Monthly close support.** "Summarize this month's P&L by department. Flag any unusual variances that need investigation before closing the books." Accelerate the close process with AI-assisted review.

**Management reporting.** "Generate the monthly financial review package: P&L summary, balance sheet highlights, cash flow statement, and key metric trends." Consistent, formatted reports from live data.

**Board reporting.** "What are the three most significant financial trends this quarter that the board should be aware of?" AI-surfaced insights from your financial data.

**Investor reporting.** "Show me ARR growth, net revenue retention, gross margin trend, and burn rate for the investor update." The metrics investors care about, directly from your systems.

**Segment reporting.** "Break down revenue and margin by product line, geography, and customer segment for the fiscal year."

## Compliance and Audit Readiness

Finance teams carry the compliance burden. MCP helps:

**SOX compliance.** "Show me all journal entries over the materiality threshold from the last quarter with their preparer and approver." Segregation of duties verification.

**Audit preparation.** "Generate the audit request list with supporting transaction details for all items." Accelerate audit response.

**Policy monitoring.** "Are there any transactions that violate our approval authority matrix?" Automated policy enforcement.

**Tax compliance.** "Summarize sales tax collected by jurisdiction for the quarter." Multi-jurisdiction tax visibility.

**Regulatory reporting.** Pull together the specific data slices required for regulatory filings without running custom reports for each requirement.

## How CorpusIQ Supports Finance Teams

**Accounting platform connectors.** Direct integration with QuickBooks, with NetSuite and other platforms expanding. Query financial data without navigating accounting software interfaces.

**Payment processor integration.** Connect Stripe for real-time payment data, refunds, disputes, and reconciliation against accounting records.

**Bank data integration.** Connect banking platforms for real-time cash position visibility. (Availability depends on bank API support.)

**Read-only defaults.** Finance connectors are read-only. Query financial data, generate reports, and perform analysis with zero risk of modifying transactions, accounts, or ledgers.

**Audit trail.** Every query is logged with user identity, timestamp, and parameters. Complete visibility into who accessed what financial data and when.

**Cross-source reconciliation.** Compare Stripe payout data against QuickBooks deposits. Identify discrepancies automatically rather than through manual reconciliation.

## FAQ: Common Questions

<details>
<summary><strong>Can MCP replace our FP&A tools?</strong></summary>

MCP complements FP&A tools by providing real-time data access and AI-powered analysis. FP&A tools excel at modeling, scenario planning, and collaborative budgeting. MCP excels at querying live data and surfacing insights. They work together.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How does this work with our ERP system?</strong></summary>

CorpusIQ supports QuickBooks today and is expanding ERP coverage. For custom ERP systems, enterprise customers can work with CorpusIQ on custom connector development.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Is financial data secure when queried through MCP?</strong></summary>
