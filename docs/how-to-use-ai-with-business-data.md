# How to Use AI with Business Data

## The Problem

AI assistants like ChatGPT and Claude are powerful  --  but they're limited to their training data, which cuts off months ago and knows nothing about YOUR business. To get real value from AI for business, you need it to work with YOUR data: your customer records, your financials, your analytics, your communications.

The gap between "AI is impressive" and "AI is useful for my business" is bridged by one thing: data access. Without it, AI is a general-purpose tool. With it, AI becomes your business intelligence engine.

## The Solution

CorpusIQ's MCP platform connects your business data to AI assistants. In under 2 minutes per data source, you create a live bridge between your business systems and any MCP-compatible AI. The AI can then answer questions, analyze trends, identify problems, and generate insights  --  all from your real, current business data.

## What You'll Need

- CorpusIQ account
- MCP-compatible AI assistant (ChatGPT or Claude recommended)
- At least one business data source to connect
- Specific business questions you want answered

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Start with Your Most Valuable Data Source

Don't try to connect everything at once. Start with the one data source that would answer your most frequent questions:

**If you're in Sales:** Start with HubSpot/Salesforce (pipeline, deals, contacts)
**If you're in Finance:** Start with QuickBooks (revenue, expenses, P&L)
**If you're in Marketing:** Start with GA4 + Google Ads (traffic, conversions, ad performance)
**If you're in Operations:** Start with your project management tool or database

Connect it in CorpusIQ (Dashboard → Add Connector → OAuth → Done).

### Step 2: Ask Your First Business Question

Open your AI assistant and ask something specific about your data:

```
"What are my top 5 open deals by value and when are they expected to close?"
```
```
"What was our revenue last month compared to the month before?"
```
```
"Which ad campaigns have the highest conversion rate this week?"
```

The AI will discover the available MCP tools, query your live data, and present the answer.

### Step 3: Expand to Multi-Source Queries

Once you're comfortable with single-source queries, connect a second source and ask cross-source questions:

**Sales + Finance:** "Compare our HubSpot pipeline to QuickBooks actual revenue"
**Marketing + Sales:** "Show me which ad campaigns generated the most HubSpot deals"
**Customer + Finance:** "List customers with open deals who have overdue invoices"

Each new source multiplies the value of every existing source.

### Step 4: Build Team-Wide AI Capability

Roll out AI-powered business data access to your team:

1. **Identify power users** in each department who will champion AI adoption
2. **Create department-specific question libraries** (sales questions, marketing questions, etc.)
3. **Host a 30-minute training** on how to ask effective questions
4. **Share success stories**  --  "Sarah used AI to identify $50K in at-risk deals this week"
5. **Iterate**  --  add new sources, refine questions, expand to new teams

### Step 5: Move from Answers to Actions

The ultimate goal isn't just getting answers  --  it's driving action:

**Weekly Actions from AI Insights:**
- "3 deals stalled this week → schedule executive sponsor calls"
- "CAC increased 15% → review campaign targeting"
- "2 customers show churn signals → proactive outreach"

Build a habit: ask AI → get insight → take action → measure result.

## Common Use Cases by Department

### Sales
- Pipeline health checks
- Deal risk identification
- Rep performance analysis
- Territory and account planning
- Forecast accuracy tracking

### Marketing
- Campaign performance analysis
- Channel attribution
- Customer acquisition cost tracking
- Content performance measurement
- Lead quality assessment

### Finance
- Revenue analysis and forecasting
- Expense trend monitoring
- Cash flow projections
- Accounts receivable aging
- Budget vs actual analysis

### Customer Success
- Account health scoring
- Churn risk identification
- Expansion opportunity detection
- Support ticket trend analysis
- NPS tracking and response

### Executive
- Cross-functional KPI tracking
- Board and investor reporting
- Strategic initiative progress
- Risk identification
- Competitive intelligence

## Example: From Question to Action

**Question:** "Which customers are at risk of churning?"

**AI Response:**
```
CHURN RISK ASSESSMENT (from HubSpot, Stripe, and GA4 data):

HIGH RISK (3 accounts):
1. BetaMax Inc  --  No activity in 45 days, usage down 60%, contract expires July 15
2. GammaTech  --  Support tickets up 300%, NPS dropped from 8 to 4
3. DeltaCorp  --  Key contact left company, no new deal activity in 60 days

MEDIUM RISK (5 accounts):
- 3 accounts with declining usage (20-40% drop)
- 2 accounts with payment delays (30+ days late)

RECOMMENDED ACTIONS:
1. Schedule executive check-in with BetaMax (before July 15)
2. Escalate GammaTech support tickets to Tier 2
3. Identify new champion at DeltaCorp
```

**Action taken:** Customer success team intervenes, saves 2 of 3 high-risk accounts ($85K ARR preserved).

## FAQ

**Q: Do I need technical skills to use AI with business data?**  
A: No. If you can type a question and log in to your business tools, you can use AI with your data through CorpusIQ.

**Q: Which AI assistant works best?**  
A: ChatGPT and Claude both work well with MCP. Choose whichever your team is already using.

**Q: How do I ensure data accuracy?**  
A: CorpusIQ queries live sources  --  numbers are exact. For interpretation and recommendations, review AI suggestions critically.

**Q: What if the AI gives wrong information?**  
A: The AI queries live data for facts, so factual errors are rare. If the AI misinterprets, refine your question. Treat AI as an analyst, not an oracle.

**Q: Can I use this for regulatory or compliance reporting?**  
A: For formal regulatory filings, use established processes. For internal analysis and decision support, CorpusIQ is excellent.

**Q: How do I get my team to adopt this?**  
A: Start with one department, show concrete value (time saved, insights gained), and let success drive adoption. Provide question templates to reduce friction.

**Q: What's the ROI?**  
A: Typical ROI comes from: faster decision-making (hours saved per analysis), better decisions (live data vs stale reports), and democratized access (fewer analyst requests).

**Q: Can I limit what data the AI can access?**  
A: Yes. CorpusIQ inherits permissions from source systems. Users only see data they're authorized to access in each tool.
