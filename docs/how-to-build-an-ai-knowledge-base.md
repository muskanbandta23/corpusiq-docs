# How to Build an AI Knowledge Base

## The Problem

Traditional knowledge bases are static repositories  --  wikis, Confluence pages, SharePoint sites, or Notion docs. They require manual updates, suffer from stale information, and force users to navigate a maze of pages to find answers. When someone asks "What's our refund policy for enterprise customers?" they should get an instant, accurate answer  --  not a link to a 6-month-old wiki page that may be outdated.

## The Solution: AI-Powered Knowledge Base with Live Data

CorpusIQ enables a new kind of knowledge base: one where AI can answer questions by querying both your documented policies AND your live business data. Instead of maintaining a separate knowledge repository, you connect your existing tools  --  and the AI becomes the interface.

## What You'll Need

- CorpusIQ account
- MCP-compatible AI assistant
- Connected data sources: documentation (Drive/Notion/OneDrive), CRM, communication tools
- (Optional) Existing knowledge base or wiki

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Connect Your Documentation Sources

Start by connecting where your documented knowledge lives:

1. **Google Drive / OneDrive / Dropbox:** Policies, SOPs, product specs, training materials
2. **Notion:** Team wikis, project documentation, company handbooks
3. **Confluence (via API or Drive exports):** Technical documentation, architecture decisions

In CorpusIQ, connect each source through OAuth. Your AI assistant can now search and retrieve content from all documentation repositories.

### Step 2: Connect Your Live Data Sources

Knowledge isn't just documents. Connect live data so questions get real-time, accurate answers:

1. **CRM (HubSpot):** Customer information, deal status, account health
2. **Accounting (QuickBooks):** Financial data, invoice status, payment history
3. **Analytics (GA4):** Website metrics, conversion data, traffic sources
4. **Email (Gmail/Outlook):** Communications history, decisions, threads
5. **Slack:** Internal discussions, announcements, tribal knowledge

### Step 3: Define Your Knowledge Domains

Organize your knowledge base by the types of questions your team asks:

| Domain | Example Questions | Data Sources |
|--------|------------------|-------------|
| **Company Policies** | "What's our PTO policy?" "How do I expense travel?" | Drive, Notion |
| **Product Knowledge** | "What features shipped in Q2?" "How does billing work?" | Drive, Notion, Slack |
| **Customer Knowledge** | "What's Acme Corp's contract status?" "Who's their account manager?" | HubSpot, Gmail |
| **Financial Knowledge** | "What's our Q2 revenue?" "What invoices are overdue?" | QuickBooks, Stripe |
| **Operational Knowledge** | "What's the deploy process?" "Who's on call this week?" | Drive, Slack, Calendar |

### Step 4: Write Effective Knowledge Queries

Train your team on the patterns that get the best results:

**Policy Lookup:**
```
"According to our employee handbook, what is the remote work policy for 
employees in different states?"
```

**Customer Intelligence:**
```
"Give me the complete history of our relationship with BetaMax Inc: 
contracts, invoices, support tickets, and recent communications"
```

**Process Guidance:**
```
"What's the step-by-step process for onboarding a new enterprise customer, 
including all the documents they need to sign?"
```

**Cross-Reference Queries:**
```
"Show me customers who signed contracts in Q1 but haven't had any activity 
in the last 60 days"
```

### Step 5: Maintain and Improve

An AI knowledge base improves with use:

1. **Review answers** periodically for accuracy
2. **Update source documents** when policies change (the AI will reflect changes immediately since it queries live)
3. **Document effective queries** so new team members can benefit from proven patterns
4. **Add new data sources** as your tool stack evolves

## Example Results

**Query:** "What's our enterprise onboarding process and which customers are currently in it?"

**AI Response:**
```
ENTERPRISE ONBOARDING PROCESS (from Onboarding SOP, Google Drive):

Phase 1  --  Kickoff (Week 1):
- Assigned account manager sends welcome email with contract summary
- Technical discovery call scheduled
- Access credentials provisioned

Phase 2  --  Implementation (Weeks 2-4):
- API integration support provided
- Data migration assistance if needed
- Weekly check-in calls with implementation engineer

Phase 3  --  Go-Live (Week 5):
- Production environment verified
- Training session for end users
- 30-day hypercare period begins

CURRENTLY IN ONBOARDING (from HubSpot):
1. Delta Industries  --  Phase 2 (Week 3)  --  AM: Sarah Chen
2. Epsilon Group  --  Phase 1 (Week 1)  --  AM: Marcus Johnson
3. Foxtrot Analytics  --  Phase 3 (Go-Live scheduled June 22)  --  AM: Sarah Chen

## CorpusIQ's Role

CorpusIQ transforms your scattered tools into a unified AI knowledge base by:

1. **Connecting all sources** through a single MCP endpoint
2. **Enabling natural language querying**  --  no search syntax, no navigation
3. **Querying live data**  --  never stale, always current
4. **Cross-referencing sources**  --  policies from Drive, customer data from CRM, both in one answer
5. **Maintaining security**  --  read-only access, inherits source permissions

## FAQ

**Q: How is this different from a wiki or Confluence?**  
A: Wikis require manual updates and navigation. An AI knowledge base answers questions directly from live data  --  no browsing, no stale pages.

**Q: Can it handle confidential information?**  
A: Yes. CorpusIQ inherits the permissions of each connected source. Users only see what they're authorized to access.

**Q: What if the AI gives a wrong answer?**  
A: Accuracy depends on your source data. Keep your policies and data up to date, and refine questions for clarity. The AI is only as accurate as the data it queries.

**Q: Do I need to migrate my existing knowledge base?**  
A: No. Connect your existing sources  --  wikis, drives, CRMs  --  and the AI queries them live. No migration needed.

**Q: Can I restrict certain data from the knowledge base?**  
A: CorpusIQ inherits permissions from source systems. If a user can't access a file in Drive, the AI can't retrieve it for them either.

**Q: How do I add new knowledge?**  
A: Add it to your existing tools normally  --  update the wiki, add a doc to Drive, update the CRM. The AI picks up changes immediately since it queries live sources.

**Q: Can this replace our internal wiki?**  
A: Yes  --  for question-answering. You may still want a wiki for browseable, structured documentation. The AI knowledge base complements rather than fully replaces traditional wikis.
