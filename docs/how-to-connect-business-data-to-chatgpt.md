# How to Connect Business Data to ChatGPT

## The Problem

You have critical business data spread across multiple tools  --  HubSpot for CRM, QuickBooks for accounting, Stripe for payments, Google Analytics for web traffic, Google Ads for marketing spend. You want to use ChatGPT to analyze this data, ask questions, and get insights. But ChatGPT can't natively access your business tools. You're stuck copy-pasting exports, building custom integrations, or worse  --  not using AI for business intelligence at all.

## The Solution: CorpusIQ MCP

CorpusIQ bridges this gap using the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**  --  an open standard developed by Anthropic that lets AI assistants discover and use external tools. CorpusIQ provides pre-built MCP connectors for 40+ business data sources. Connect in 2 minutes, start asking ChatGPT about your business data immediately.

## What You'll Need

- A **CorpusIQ account** (free tier available at corpusiq.io)
- Access to your business data sources (HubSpot, QuickBooks, Stripe, etc.)
- A ChatGPT subscription that supports MCP (ChatGPT Plus, Team, or Enterprise with MCP enabled)

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Create Your CorpusIQ Account

1. Go to [corpusiq.io](https://corpusiq.io) and click **Sign Up**
2. Create an account with your work email
3. Verify your email address
4. Log in to your CorpusIQ dashboard

### Step 2: Connect Your Data Sources

1. From the CorpusIQ dashboard, click **Add Connector**
2. Select your first data source  --  for example, **HubSpot**
3. Click **Connect** to initiate the OAuth flow
4. Log in to HubSpot and authorize CorpusIQ to access your data (read-only)
5. Repeat for additional sources: QuickBooks, Stripe, GA4, Google Ads, Slack, etc.

Each connection takes under 60 seconds. CorpusIQ handles authentication, token management, and API versioning automatically.

### Step 3: Configure ChatGPT for MCP

1. Open ChatGPT
2. Navigate to **Settings → Integrations → MCP Servers**
3. Click **Add MCP Server**
4. From your CorpusIQ dashboard, copy your **MCP Server URL** (looks like: `https://mcp.corpusiq.com/your-workspace-id`)
5. Paste it into ChatGPT's MCP server configuration
6. ChatGPT will discover your available data tools automatically

### Step 4: Start Asking Business Questions

Now your ChatGPT has access to your business data. Try these example questions:

**CRM Questions:**
- "Show me all HubSpot deals closing this month"
- "Which companies haven't had activity in the last 60 days?"
- "What's our pipeline value by deal stage?"

**Financial Questions:**
- "What's our revenue this quarter compared to last quarter?"
- "Show me overdue invoices sorted by amount"
- "What's our profit and loss for the last 30 days?"

**Marketing Questions:**
- "Compare Google Ads spend to GA4 conversions by week"
- "Which ad campaigns have the highest ROAS?"
- "What's our website traffic trend this month?"

### Step 5: Cross-Source Analysis

The real power comes from combining sources. Ask questions that span multiple tools:

- "Compare HubSpot pipeline value to QuickBooks actual revenue this quarter"
- "Show me Stripe payments from customers with open HubSpot deals"
- "How does Google Ads spend correlate with GA4 ecommerce revenue?"

CorpusIQ queries each source live and the AI combines results into a coherent answer.

## Example Results

**Question:** "What's our sales pipeline look like this quarter?"

**ChatGPT's response (powered by CorpusIQ + HubSpot):**
```
Your Q2 2026 sales pipeline:

| Stage          | Count | Total Value  |
|----------------|-------|-------------|
| Discovery      | 12    | $145,000    |
| Qualification  | 8     | $210,000    |
| Proposal       | 5     | $320,000    |
| Negotiation    | 3     | $180,000    |
| Closed Won     | 7     | $425,000    |

Total Pipeline: 35 deals worth $1,280,000
Pipeline Velocity: $305,000 closed this quarter vs $280,000 same period last quarter (+8.9%)
```

## CorpusIQ's Role

CorpusIQ handles everything between ChatGPT and your data sources:

1. **Authentication:** OAuth flows, token refresh, credential management
2. **Tool Discovery:** MCP protocol implementation so ChatGPT knows what data is available
3. **Query Execution:** Translating AI tool calls into API requests
4. **Data Formatting:** Structuring API responses for AI consumption
5. **Scoped direct-MCP retention.** CorpusIQ uses read-only access for direct MCP live retrieval. It does not retain raw customer files or full connector response payloads; operational logs retain query text, per-user tool-call metadata, and bounded outcome summaries for up to 30 days.
6. **Rate Limiting:** Managing API quotas and retries transparently

## FAQ

**Q: Is my data secure when connecting to ChatGPT?**  
A: CorpusIQ uses read-only access for direct MCP live retrieval. It does not retain raw customer files or full connector response payloads; operational logs retain query text, per-user tool-call metadata, and bounded outcome summaries for up to 30 days.
