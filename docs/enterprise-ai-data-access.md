# Enterprise AI Data Access: Security, Compliance, and Architecture

Enterprise organizations face a unique tension when adopting AI-powered data access: the business demands real-time answers from dozens of systems, but security and compliance teams require guarantees that would traditionally block real-time access entirely. The result is often paralysis  --  AI initiatives stall while security reviews drag on, or worse, teams bypass security controls to get the access they need.

CorpusIQ's MCP platform resolves this tension by providing an enterprise AI data access layer that meets the most stringent security requirements while delivering the real-time, natural-language data access that business teams expect. This guide covers the security architecture, compliance framework, and deployment model that make enterprise-grade AI data access possible  --  and why building the equivalent in-house typically takes 12-18 months of engineering effort.

## The Enterprise AI Data Access Problem

Giving an AI assistant access to enterprise business data sounds simple: connect the AI to the APIs. But in a regulated enterprise environment, that "simple connection" needs to satisfy a long list of requirements:

- **Authentication and identity.** The AI must authenticate as a known user  --  not as a service account with broad permissions. Single sign-on (SSO) must integrate with the enterprise identity provider. Multi-factor authentication must be enforced. Session policies must align with corporate security standards.

- **Authorization and scope.** The AI must only access data the authenticated user is authorized to see. Permissions must be granular  --  a marketing analyst querying campaign performance should not be able to access financial ledger data. Department-level data boundaries must be enforced.

- **Audit trails.** Every data access must be logged in detail: who queried what, when, from where, with what parameters, and what result was returned. These logs must be immutable, exportable to SIEM systems, and retained according to compliance requirements.

- **Data residency.** Global enterprises should validate the complete processing path: storage, network transit, source-provider processing, the selected AI client, logs, and backups. Choosing a regional CorpusIQ deployment alone does not guarantee that every dependency remains in-region.

- **Scoped direct-MCP retention.** External-source retrieval tools are marked read-only. The direct MCP path does not retain raw customer files or full connector response payloads; operational logs retain query text, per-user tool-call metadata, and bounded outcome summaries for up to 30 days.

- **Compliance certifications.** The solution must hold relevant certifications  --  SOC 2 Type II at minimum  --  and support the enterprise's own compliance frameworks including GDPR, CCPA, and industry-specific regulations.

This is a formidable set of requirements. Building a system that satisfies all of them from scratch is a major engineering undertaking. CorpusIQ provides this system out of the box, built on the Model Context Protocol's secure architecture.

## How CorpusIQ Enables Enterprise AI Data Access

CorpusIQ's enterprise AI data access architecture is built on five pillars:

### 1. Identity and Access Management

**SAML 2.0 and OpenID Connect.** CorpusIQ integrates with every major enterprise identity provider  --  Okta, Azure AD (Entra ID), Ping Identity, OneLogin, Google Workspace, and any SAML 2.0 or OIDC-compatible IdP. Employees sign in with their corporate credentials. No separate CorpusIQ passwords to manage, no credentials to phish, no shadow IT accounts.

**Role-based access control (RBAC).** Administrators define roles mapped to directory groups. A "Marketing Analyst" role might have access to Google Analytics, Meta Ads, and HubSpot marketing tools. A "Finance Analyst" role might have access to QuickBooks, Stripe, and NetSuite. A "Sales Operations" role might access Salesforce, HubSpot CRM, and LinkedIn Ads. Users only see and can query the data sources their role permits.

**Just-in-time provisioning.** When a new employee joins a directory group with CorpusIQ access, their account is automatically provisioned. When they leave the group  --  or leave the organization  --  access is automatically revoked. No manual account management. No lingering access for departed employees.

**Multi-factor authentication enforcement.** MFA is enforced at the identity provider level. CorpusIQ inherits the MFA policies already configured in Okta or Azure AD  --  including hardware token requirements, biometric authentication, and conditional access policies.

**Per-user OAuth scoping.** When a user connects a data source through OAuth, CorpusIQ requests provider scopes required for the documented operations. Retrieval and write-capable tools remain separately named and annotated regardless of provider scope grouping. Each user authenticates individually  --  there are no shared service accounts that would obscure who accessed what data.

### 2. Read-Only External Retrieval with Explicit Control-Plane Writes

CorpusIQ separates external-source retrieval from writes to user-declared CorpusIQ control-plane state. The boundary is enforced at multiple levels:

- **Protocol level.** External-source retrieval tools carry read-only annotations. Explicit control-plane tools that update or remove user-declared facts, decisions, metric specifications, and source manifests carry separate non-read-only and destructive annotations where applicable.

- **OAuth scope level.** External-source connectors request the provider scopes required for their documented operations. When a provider groups permissions into a broader scope, CorpusIQ still exposes retrieval and write-capable operations as separately named, safety-annotated tools.

- **Connector level.** External-source retrieval implementations validate operations against a capability matrix and block write-back. Write-capable connector operations, when exposed, are separately named and annotated.

- **AI model level.** External connector descriptions identify retrieval behavior, while CorpusIQ control-plane descriptions state the supported state mutation explicitly.

This defense-in-depth approach keeps retrieval tools from writing back. Supported write-capable connector and CorpusIQ control-plane mutations remain explicit, separately named, and safety-annotated.

### 3. Comprehensive Audit Trails

Every tool call through CorpusIQ is logged with full context:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Timestamp | When the query was executed (UTC, millisecond precision) |
| User identity | Which authenticated user initiated the query |
| Source IP | Where the query originated from |
| Tool name | Which connector and operation was called |
| Parameters | What filters, date ranges, and arguments were used |
| Source system | Which platform was queried |
| Response status | Success, error, timeout, or permission denied |
| Query duration | How long the source API took to respond |

These audit logs serve compliance, security monitoring, and operational purposes:

- **Compliance.** Demonstrate data access controls for SOC 2, GDPR, SOX, and industry-specific frameworks. Every data access has a timestamp, a user identity, and a purpose.

- **Security monitoring.** Detect anomalous query patterns  --  queries at unusual hours, from unexpected IP ranges, against data sources the user doesn't normally access.

- **SIEM integration.** Export audit logs to Splunk, Sumo Logic, Datadog, or any SIEM platform for centralized monitoring and alerting. CorpusIQ supports real-time streaming of audit events.

- **Operational debugging.** Trace why a particular answer was returned by reviewing the exact tool calls, parameters, and source responses.

Operational logs are protected from user edits and retained for up to 30 days under the published schedule. They contain query text, per-user tool-call metadata, and bounded outcome summaries rather than raw customer files or full connector response payloads.

### 4. Scoped Direct-MCP Retention

CorpusIQ's direct MCP path uses live retrieval with scoped operational retention:

- **Scoped direct-MCP retention.** External-source retrieval tools are marked read-only. The direct MCP path does not retain raw customer files or full connector response payloads; operational logs retain query text, per-user tool-call metadata, and bounded outcome summaries for up to 30 days.

- **Direct-MCP index scope.** The direct path uses typed API calls and does not build embeddings or file indexes; optional indexed search is separate and retains embeddings plus minimal metadata until connector revocation or account deletion.

- **Fresh direct queries.** Each direct MCP query requests current source data rather than serving a persisted full-response cache.

- **Tenant isolation.** Authentication and token lookup are user-scoped; multi-tenant infrastructure does not imply shared authorization or cross-tenant result access.

CorpusIQ stores encrypted authentication tokens and connector configuration while connections are active. Local AUDIT logs record raw query text and tool parameters plus bounded result summaries; the Azure Log Analytics workspace retains those logs for 30 days. Optional indexed search has a separate embeddings and minimal-metadata lifecycle.

### 5. Enterprise Compliance Framework

**SOC 2 posture.** CorpusIQ maintains a SOC 2 aligned security posture; formal SOC 2 Type II certification is not claimed.

**CASA Tier 2.** CorpusIQ has achieved CASA (Cloud Application Security Assessment) Tier 2, the highest tier in the Google-recognized cloud security assessment framework. This certification validates that CorpusIQ meets the security requirements of the most demanding enterprise cloud deployments.

**GDPR alignment.** Direct MCP retrieval does not retain raw customer files or full connector response payloads. Operational logs retain query text, per-user tool-call metadata, and bounded outcome summaries for up to 30 days; optional indexed search has a separate lifecycle. This scoped model supports data-minimization and purpose-limitation assessments. Regional deployment requests require customer-specific validation of the complete processing path.

**Custom compliance frameworks.** Enterprise customers with specific compliance needs  --  PCI DSS, HIPAA (with BAA), SOX, FedRAMP  --  can work with CorpusIQ on custom deployment configurations including dedicated infrastructure, enhanced audit capabilities, and additional compliance documentation.

## Enterprise AI Data Access: Build vs Buy

The question every enterprise faces: build an AI data access layer in-house or adopt a platform like CorpusIQ. Here's what building in-house entails:

**Authentication and SSO integration.** Build SAML/OIDC integration with your identity provider. Implement JIT provisioning, session management, MFA enforcement. Handle token refresh, session timeout, and concurrent session policies. **Engineering effort: 4-8 weeks.**

**Connector development.** Write and maintain API integrations for 20-50 business platforms. Handle OAuth flows, rate limiting, pagination, error recovery, schema changes. Each connector requires ongoing maintenance as APIs evolve. **Engineering effort: 3-4 weeks per connector, ongoing maintenance.**

**Read-only enforcement.** Build a capability matrix that validates every API call against allowed operations. Implement at the API gateway, service, and connector levels. **Engineering effort: 2-3 weeks.**

**Audit logging.** Build an audit logging system with immutable storage, structured log format, SIEM export, configurable retention, and real-time streaming. **Engineering effort: 3-5 weeks.**

**AI model integration.** Build the tool discovery, function calling, and response synthesis layer that connects AI models to your data connectors. Handle prompt engineering, context window management, tool selection logic. **Engineering effort: 6-12 weeks.**

**Infrastructure and operations.** Provision and manage cloud infrastructure, implement high availability, configure monitoring and alerting, handle scaling. **Engineering effort: ongoing.**

**Compliance certification.** Go through SOC 2 audit (6-12 months), CASA assessment, customer security reviews. **Timeline: 12+ months.**

**Total in-house build: 12-18 months of engineering, $500K-$1.5M in engineering cost, plus ongoing maintenance.**

CorpusIQ provides this stack  --  40+ enterprise connectors, SSO integration, RBAC, read-only enforcement, audit trails, a SOC 2 aligned posture, CASA Tier 2 certification by DEKRA, and managed infrastructure  --  without requiring customers to build the connector layer themselves.

## How It Works

**Step 1: SSO configuration.** Integrate CorpusIQ with your identity provider (Okta, Azure AD, Ping Identity, etc.) through SAML 2.0 or OpenID Connect. Configure role mappings to your existing directory groups. Typical setup: 1-2 hours with your IT team.

**Step 2: Data source connections.** Business users connect their platforms through OAuth. Provider scopes vary by connector and documented operation; retrieval and write-capable tools remain separately named and annotated. Typical setup: 2-5 minutes per data source.

**Step 3: Department-level governance.** Administrators configure which roles can access which data sources. Marketing connects its analytics stack. Finance connects its accounting platforms. Sales connects its CRM. Cross-department queries respect these boundaries  --  a marketing user cannot accidentally query financial data.

**Step 4: AI-powered querying.** Users ask natural-language questions through any MCP-enabled AI assistant. The AI discovers available tools, selects the right ones, and queries live data sources. Answers arrive in seconds with full source citation and audit trail.

## Use Cases

**Executive reporting.** The CFO asks "what's our global Q2 revenue, broken down by region and compared to forecast?"  --  a question that spans ERP, CRM, and financial planning systems. CorpusIQ queries all relevant platforms and returns a consolidated answer with source citations for every number.

**Compliance verification.** The compliance team asks "show me all transactions over $100,000 from the last quarter with their approval records." CorpusIQ queries the ERP and approval workflow systems simultaneously, returning an audit-ready report.

**Marketing spend analysis.** The CMO asks "what's our total marketing spend this quarter, how does it break down by channel, and what revenue has been attributed to each channel?" CorpusIQ queries Meta Ads, Google Ads, LinkedIn Ads, Google Analytics, and the CRM  --  five platforms, one question, one answer.

**M&A data integration.** When acquiring a company, the integration team connects the acquired company's platforms to CorpusIQ. Within hours, they have visibility into revenue, pipeline, customer base, and financials  --  without waiting months for formal system integration.

**Departmental self-service.** The VP of Sales asks "which reps are pacing above quota this quarter, and which deals in the pipeline need executive engagement?" The VP gets an answer from live CRM data without filing a ticket with the data team.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: How does CorpusIQ integrate with our existing SSO provider?**
A: CorpusIQ supports SAML 2.0 and OpenID Connect, integrating with Okta, Azure AD (Entra ID), Ping Identity, OneLogin, Google Workspace, and any standards-compliant identity provider. Configuration typically takes 1-2 hours and maps your existing directory groups to CorpusIQ roles.

**Q: Does CorpusIQ store our business data?**
A: CorpusIQ uses read-only access for direct MCP live retrieval. It does not retain raw customer files or full connector response payloads; operational logs retain query text, per-user tool-call metadata, and bounded outcome summaries for up to 30 days.

**Q: What compliance certifications does CorpusIQ hold?**
A: CorpusIQ maintains a SOC 2 aligned security posture and is CASA Tier 2 certified by DEKRA. Formal SOC 2 Type II certification is not claimed.

**Q: How do you enforce that users can only access data they're authorized to see?**
A: Through role-based access control (RBAC) mapped to your existing directory groups. Each role has specific data source permissions. OAuth connections are per-user, so each user authenticates individually and inherits their own permissions from the source platform.

**Q: Can CorpusIQ write data to our business systems?**
A: External-source retrieval tools do not write back. Write-capable connector and CorpusIQ control-plane tools are separately named and safety-annotated.

**Q: Where is CorpusIQ infrastructure located, and can we control data residency?**
A: Enterprise customers can request a deployment region, subject to validation of storage, network transit, source-provider processing, the selected AI client, logs, and backups. Contact sales@corpusiq.io for a customer-specific residency assessment.

**Q: How long are audit logs retained?**
A: The Azure Log Analytics workspace retains operational MCP logs for 30 days.

**Q: How is this different from giving employees direct API access to our systems?**
A: Direct API access requires granting credentials that can potentially read, write, or modify data  --  and those credentials can be leaked, misused, or forgotten. CorpusIQ provides read-only external-source retrieval with separately annotated CorpusIQ control-plane operations, per-user authentication, granular RBAC, and audit trails.

**Q: What's the deployment timeline for an enterprise rollout?**
A: A departmental pilot can be operational in days  --  SSO configuration takes 1-2 hours, and data source connections take minutes each. Full enterprise deployment with governance policies, role mappings, and multi-department rollout typically takes 2-4 weeks.

**Q: Can we build custom connectors for proprietary internal systems?**
A: Yes. CorpusIQ's enterprise offering includes support for custom MCP connector development. Your internal ERP, proprietary databases, and homegrown applications can be exposed as MCP tools alongside the standard connector library.
