# Secure AI Data Connectivity

Connecting AI assistants to business data introduces security risks that traditional SaaS integrations never faced. AI models can hallucinate, leak data across sessions, and create attack surfaces that didn't exist before. Secure AI data connectivity is the practice of enabling AI assistants to query business systems while maintaining zero-trust security principles, data minimization, and full auditability.

CorpusIQ connects ChatGPT, Claude, and other AI assistants to business tools using scoped OAuth, explicit data-handling boundaries, and encrypted transport.

## FAQ

### What is secure AI data connectivity?
Secure AI data connectivity is the architectural practice of connecting AI models to business data sources through encrypted, authenticated, and audited channels. It limits retrieval to authorized requests and makes retention explicit by product path. CorpusIQ does not use customer data to train models; conversation handling follows the selected AI provider's plan and settings.

### How does CorpusIQ keep my data secure?
CorpusIQ uses HTTPS/TLS for data in transit and Azure-managed encryption for persisted service data. External source connectors use read-only vendor access where that is the documented connector contract. Direct MCP requests use live retrieval without building embeddings or file indexes; optional indexed-search features use embeddings and minimal metadata. CorpusIQ is CASA Tier 2 certified by DEKRA.

### Does the AI model see my raw data?
CorpusIQ sits between your tools and the AI assistant. It sends the requesting AI client the source data needed for the requested tool result and citations; it does not give the model persistent provider access. Direct MCP requests do not build embeddings or file indexes.

### Can CorpusIQ modify my data?
External source connectors are designed for read-only retrieval and do not write back to those connected vendor systems. Explicit CorpusIQ control-plane tools can update or remove user-declared facts, decisions, metric specifications, and source manifests when the user requests those actions. Review the exact vendor scopes on each OAuth authorization screen and the safety annotations on the selected tool.

### What encryption standards does CorpusIQ use?
CorpusIQ uses HTTPS/TLS for data in transit and the encryption-at-rest controls of its managed Azure services. Customer-specific requirements for keys, rotation, residency, backups, or dedicated infrastructure should be validated during an enterprise security review rather than inferred from this overview.

### What happens to my data after a query?
Direct MCP requests do not retain raw customer files or full connector response payloads. Query text, per-user tool-call metadata, and bounded outcome summaries remain in operational logs for up to 30 days. Optional indexed-search features may retain embeddings and minimal metadata while the connector remains active.

### How does token security work?
Short-lived access tokens and server-side refresh handling limit long-lived bearer exposure. OAuth credentials are kept out of public client bundles and stored in managed server-side secret storage. Revocation and refresh behavior depend on the credential type and provider contract.

## How It Works

CorpusIQ acts as a secure proxy between AI assistants and your business data:

```
AI Assistant → CorpusIQ MCP Server → HTTPS/TLS → Scoped OAuth → Business Tools
                    ↓
           Live Tool Result (no direct-MCP file index)
                    ↓
           Tool Result with Source Citations
```

1. **Authentication:** The user authenticates through the connector's documented OAuth flow and reviews the requested vendor scopes.
2. **Query Processing:** When an AI assistant asks a question, CorpusIQ routes it to the relevant authorized source tools. External-source retrieval tools do not write back to those vendor systems; explicit CorpusIQ control-plane tools have separate safety annotations.
3. **Direct MCP Processing:** Results are fetched in real time and returned with source citations without building embeddings or file indexes; optional indexed search is the separate mode described next.
4. **Optional Indexed Search:** Separate indexed-search features may use embeddings and minimal metadata in a per-user namespace.
5. **Audit Trail:** Local AUDIT logs record raw query text and tool parameters plus bounded result summaries. The Azure Log Analytics workspace retains those logs for 30 days.

## Benefits

### Read-Only External Retrieval
External source connectors are designed not to write back to connected vendor systems. CorpusIQ control-plane operations that update or remove user-declared facts, decisions, metric specifications, and source manifests remain explicit and separately annotated.

### Scoped Data Handling
Direct MCP requests use live retrieval without retaining raw customer files or full connector response payloads. Operational query logs are retained for up to 30 days. Optional indexed-search features have a separate embeddings-and-metadata lifecycle.

### Ephemeral Context
The requesting AI client receives the tool result needed for the current request. CorpusIQ does not use customer data for model training and does not grant the model persistent provider access.

### Encryption in Transit and at Rest
HTTPS/TLS protects supported network paths. Managed Azure services provide encryption at rest for persisted service data; customer-specific cryptographic and residency requirements require deployment review.

### Granular Access Control
Per-user OAuth and connector identity mapping scope requests to the authorized user's source accounts. CorpusIQ's isolation controls are designed to prevent cross-user credential reuse; enterprise reviews should validate any provider-side shared-account or service-account configuration separately.

### Verified Security Posture
CASA Tier 2 certified by DEKRA. CorpusIQ maintains a SOC 2 aligned posture; formal SOC 2 certification is not claimed.

## Use Cases

### Financial Services Compliance
Financial teams can use CorpusIQ for analysis against authorized QuickBooks and Stripe data. CorpusIQ does not confer PCI DSS or SOX compliance; each organization must validate its own controls, source scopes, AI-provider plan, and deployment.

### Healthcare Data Privacy
Healthcare organizations must evaluate any EHR connection, CorpusIQ retention class, and selected AI-provider plan against their own PHI and regulatory requirements. CorpusIQ does not claim that every processing path remains inside a healthcare boundary.

### Enterprise Knowledge Management
Large enterprises can connect SharePoint, Google Drive, and Notion while preserving source permissions. Data processing and residency still depend on CorpusIQ's documented retention classes, deployment region, and the selected AI-provider plan.

### Ecommerce Analytics
Shopify merchants can connect stores to AI assistants for sales analysis, inventory forecasting, and customer segmentation through the connector's read-only external-source retrieval contract.

### Agency Client Reporting
Marketing agencies can connect authorized Google Analytics, Meta Ads, and HubSpot accounts to Claude for reporting. Per-user OAuth and connector identity mapping are part of the isolation boundary; agencies remain responsible for configuring distinct client identities and permissions.
