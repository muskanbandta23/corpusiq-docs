# How to Connect Google Analytics to ChatGPT with CorpusIQ MCP

Your **Google Analytics** account holds critical business data  --  but accessing insights usually means logging in, navigating dashboards, and running manual reports. **Connecting Google Analytics to ChatGPT through CorpusIQ MCP** eliminates all that friction. Once connected via a secure OAuth flow, ChatGPT can query your live Google Analytics data directly  --  you ask questions in plain English, and get cited answers drawn from your actual account, not outdated exports or screenshots.

Once connected, ChatGPT can query your live GA4 data  --  traffic, sessions, users, conversions, and ecommerce revenue. You ask questions in plain English and get answers from your actual analytics property, not exported spreadsheets or outdated dashboards.

This page covers the connection architecture, what you can ask, cross-source capabilities, security, and how MCP compares to using GA4's native interface or API.

## FAQ: Common Questions

<details>
<summary><strong>What web analytics questions can I ask ChatGPT?</strong></summary>

Traffic questions: "What was our total website traffic last week?", "Which pages got the most views this month?", "How many users did we have yesterday?" Conversion questions: "What's our conversion rate for the last 30 days?", "Which traffic source has the highest conversion rate?" Ecommerce questions: "What was our ecommerce revenue from organic search this month?", "Show me revenue by product category." Campaign questions: "How much traffic did our latest email campaign drive?", "Which ad campaigns generated the most conversions?"
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How does CorpusIQ connect GA4 to ChatGPT?</strong></summary>

CorpusIQ connects to your Google Analytics account via OAuth 2.0. You select which GA4 property to connect, authorize read-only access, then connect the CorpusIQ MCP server to ChatGPT. ChatGPT discovers the available analytics tools and calls them when you ask a question. The MCP server handles the GA4 Data API, dimension/metric mapping, and date range construction automatically.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What GA4 data can ChatGPT access?</strong></summary>

Traffic metrics: sessions, users, new users, pageviews, screen views. Engagement metrics: average engagement time, engaged sessions, bounce rate. Conversion metrics: conversions, conversion rate, event count. Ecommerce metrics: purchase revenue, transactions, item revenue, add-to-carts. All broken down by dimensions like date, source/medium, country, device category, landing page, and campaign.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Is this read-only?</strong></summary>

Yes. The Google Analytics API is inherently read-only  --  it provides analytics data, not configuration access. CorpusIQ requests the minimum OAuth scopes needed to read analytics data. ChatGPT cannot modify your GA4 property settings, create events, or alter tracking configuration.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can ChatGPT compare GA4 data with data from other tools?</strong></summary>

This is where MCP creates value beyond what GA4 alone can offer. "Did our Google Ads campaigns drive more revenue than our email campaigns this month?" queries GA4 for conversion data, Google Ads for spend data, and Klaviyo for email campaign data  --  all in one response. "How does our website traffic correlate with Shopify orders?" combines GA4 and Shopify data. Cross-source analytics is the core capability of [MCP platforms like CorpusIQ](benefits-of-mcp-for-business.md).
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How is this different from using GA4's built-in reports?</strong></summary>

GA4's built-in reports are pre-constructed views with specific dimensions and metrics. They're useful for standard analysis but limit you to what Google decided to include. With ChatGPT, every question is a custom report: "Show me the bounce rate for mobile users from paid search who landed on product pages" is a question you'd struggle to build in GA4's interface but can ask naturally in ChatGPT. You're not limited to pre-built reports  --  you ask exactly what you need.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How does this handle GA4's event-based data model?</strong></summary>

GA4's event-based model is powerful but complex. Events have parameters, and understanding which event maps to which business metric requires GA4 expertise. CorpusIQ's MCP layer abstracts this complexity. You ask about "conversions" or "purchases" in natural language, and the MCP server maps to the correct GA4 events and parameters. You don't need to know the event names or parameter keys.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What about real-time data?</strong></summary>

CorpusIQ supports GA4's real-time reporting. You can ask "How many active users are on our site right now?" or "What pages are real-time users viewing?" This real-time capability lets you monitor campaign launches, product releases, or promotional events as they happen.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I query multiple GA4 properties?</strong></summary>

Yes. Connect multiple GA4 properties to CorpusIQ. Compare traffic across properties, or combine data for a portfolio view: "Show me total traffic across all our properties this month."
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What about historical data?</strong></summary>

GA4 properties have a data retention setting (2 months or 14 months by default). CorpusIQ can query any data within your property's retention window. For data beyond the retention window, you'd need BigQuery export  --  a topic covered in our [GA4 connector reference](connect-google-analytics-to-chatgpt.md).
</details>

## How It Works

1. **Connect GA4 to CorpusIQ.** Dashboard → Connections → Google Analytics → sign into Google → select your GA4 property → authorize read-only access. CorpusIQ lists all properties across your Google Analytics accounts so you can choose the right one.

2. **Connect CorpusIQ to ChatGPT.** Add the CorpusIQ MCP server. ChatGPT discovers tools for running GA4 reports, listing properties, and accessing real-time data.

3. **Ask analytics questions.** ChatGPT maps your question to the correct dimensions, metrics, and date ranges, calls the GA4 reporting tool, and returns a cited answer.

4. **Drill down conversationally.** "Now show me that by device category" or "Compare that to last month"  --  follow-ups build on previous results.

No GA4 report building. No dimension/metric memorization. No data exports.

## Benefits

**Ad-hoc analytics without GA4 expertise.** Your marketing team, product managers, and executives can get analytics answers without understanding GA4's event model, report builder, or exploration interface. Natural language is the only prerequisite.

**Faster marketing decisions.** "Which campaign drove the most conversions yesterday?" takes 5 seconds instead of 5 minutes of report building. During a campaign launch or promotional period, that speed matters.

**Cross-channel attribution.** Combine GA4 traffic data with Google Ads spend data, email campaign data, and Shopify revenue data. "Which marketing channel had the best ROAS this month?" becomes a single question across three or more data sources.

**Unlimited custom reports.** Every question is a custom report. You're not limited to the dimensions and metrics GA4's report builder supports. "Show me the conversion rate for users who viewed at least 3 pages and came from organic search" is a complex GA4 exploration  --  or a simple ChatGPT question.

**Source-cited answers.** Every response includes which GA4 property, what date range, and what dimensions/metrics were queried. If a number looks off, you can trace it back to the source query.

## Use Cases

### Daily Traffic Monitoring

"What was our traffic yesterday compared to the same day last week?" "Which pages had the biggest traffic changes?" Start every morning with a traffic pulse  --  no GA4 login required.

### Content Performance

"Show me our top 20 pages by traffic this month." "Which blog posts have the highest engagement time?" "What content drove the most conversions?" Content teams get performance insights conversationally.

### Campaign Analysis

"Which UTM campaigns performed best this month?" "Show me traffic by source/medium for the last 30 days." "What's the conversion rate for paid search campaigns?" Marketing teams analyze campaign performance without building GA4 explorations.

### Ecommerce Analytics

"Show me ecommerce revenue by product category this week." "What's our add-to-cart rate by traffic source?" "Which products have the highest purchase conversion rate?" Ecommerce teams get product performance data alongside traffic data.

### Cross-Source Attribution

Combine GA4 with ad platforms and ecommerce tools: "Show me Google Ads spend vs. GA4 attributed revenue by day" or "How does email campaign send volume correlate with website sessions?" See our [MCP for Marketing guide](mcp-for-marketing.md) for more attribution patterns.

## Security: Read-Only Analytics Access

The GA4 integration is inherently safe:

- **Google Analytics API is read-only.** There is no write path to modify your analytics data or property configuration.
- **OAuth 2.0** with Google's analytics read scopes. No admin or edit scopes are requested.
- **Scoped direct-MCP retention.** CorpusIQ uses read-only access for direct MCP live retrieval. It does not retain raw customer files or full connector response payloads; operational logs retain query text, per-user tool-call metadata, and bounded outcome summaries for up to 30 days.
- **TLS 1.3** encryption for all data in transit.

For organizations concerned about data access, the GA4 integration provides analytics data without exposing property configuration  --  a clean separation of data access and administrative control.

## Comparison: MCP vs. GA4 Native Interface

| Aspect | GA4 Native Interface | CorpusIQ MCP + ChatGPT |
|--------|---------------------|------------------------|
| **Query method** | Report builder, explorations, pre-built reports | Natural language |
| **Custom reports** | Limited to available dimensions/metrics | Any question you can ask |
| **Learning curve** | Requires GA4 event model and interface knowledge | No training required |
| **Multi-property** | One property at a time | Compare across properties naturally |
| **Cross-source** | GA4 data only | Combine with ad platforms, CRM, ecommerce |
| **Speed for ad-hoc** | Minutes to build each custom query | Seconds per question |
| **Sharing** | Share report links or screenshots | Ask in a shared ChatGPT conversation |

GA4's interface is essential for deep exploration, event debugging, and configuration. For day-to-day analytics questions, ChatGPT with MCP is faster and more flexible.

## Comparison: MCP vs. Direct GA4 API Integration

| Aspect | Direct GA4 API | CorpusIQ MCP |
|--------|---------------|--------------|
| **Setup** | API client, OAuth, dimension/metric API mapping | 2-minute OAuth connection |
| **Query construction** | JSON request bodies with dimension/metric arrays | Natural language |
| **Date handling** | Manual date range construction | Automatic date interpretation |
| **Pagination** | Must implement token-based pagination | Handled automatically |
| **Multi-source** | Build separate integrations for each data source | One connection for all tools |

The GA4 Data API is powerful but requires significant engineering to make conversational. MCP provides that conversational layer out of the box.
