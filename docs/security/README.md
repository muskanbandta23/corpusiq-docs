# Security

CorpusIQ is designed with security as a foundational requirement. External-source retrieval tools are marked read-only. Write-capable connector and CorpusIQ control-plane tools are separately named and carry behavior-matched safety annotations.

## Authentication

### AI Chat Users
- Email-based authentication at [demo.corpusiq.io](https://demo.corpusiq.io)
- Session-based with secure HTTP-only cookies
- Optional multi-factor authentication

### AI Agent Users
- OAuth 2.0 Device Authorization Grant (RFC 8628)
- No browser required for ongoing agent access
- Refresh token rotation
- Device verification prevents unauthorized access
- Dashboard disconnect removes CorpusIQ connection state and requires reauthorization before reuse; provider authorization remains provider-governed

### Data Source Connections
- OAuth 2.0 authorization for each connected source
- Scoped access: CorpusIQ requests minimum required permissions
- CorpusIQ connections can be disconnected individually
- Credential-based connectors store required secrets encrypted; public responses do not expose them

## Data Access

### Scoped Access Policy
External-source retrieval tools query connected sources, normalize results, and do not write back. Write-capable connector and CorpusIQ control-plane tools are separately named and carry behavior-matched safety annotations.

### Data Handling
- Direct MCP retrieves source records on demand and delivers scoped results to the requesting client
- Raw customer files and full connector response payloads are not retained by the direct path
- Operational query text, per-user tool-call metadata, and bounded outcome summaries may be retained for up to 30 days
- Optional indexed search retains embeddings and minimal metadata until connector revocation or account deletion

## Encryption

- HTTPS/TLS 1.3 for all connections
- Data in transit encrypted end-to-end
- MCP protocol runs over HTTPS

## Audit

- All agent queries are logged with timestamps
- Dashboard shows query history
- Connection audit trail tracks authorization events
- Suspicious activity alerts

## Best Practices

- Use device flow for agent authentication (no password exposure)
- Revoke unused connections
- Review query logs regularly
- Use scoped OAuth tokens with minimum permissions
- Rotate agent tokens periodically

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: How does CorpusIQ authenticate users?**  
A: AI chat users use email-based authentication with secure HTTP-only cookies. AI agent users use OAuth 2.0 Device Authorization Grant (RFC 8628) with refresh token rotation. Data-source provider scopes vary by connector and documented operation.

**Q: Is CorpusIQ data access read-only?**
A: External-source retrieval is read-only and does not write back to connected vendor systems. Explicit CorpusIQ control-plane tools can modify user-declared CorpusIQ state and are separately annotated.

**Q: What encryption does CorpusIQ use?**  
A: HTTPS/TLS 1.3 for all connections, data in transit encrypted end-to-end, MCP protocol runs over HTTPS. All connections are encrypted with forward secrecy.
