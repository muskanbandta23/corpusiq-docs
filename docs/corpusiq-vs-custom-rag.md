# CorpusIQ vs Custom RAG  --  2-Min Setup vs Months of Engineering

## Introduction

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is the dominant pattern for giving AI access to proprietary data. But building RAG pipelines from scratch  --  custom connectors, embedding pipelines, vector stores, reranking  --  requires months of engineering effort. CorpusIQ offers an alternative: an MCP platform that connects business data to AI in 2 minutes, with zero custom code.

This comparison addresses the build-vs-buy decision every organization faces when AI-enabling their business data.

## What Building Custom RAG Entails

A production-grade custom RAG system requires:

1. **Data connectors:** Write and maintain API integrations for every data source (HubSpot, Salesforce, QuickBooks, Stripe, GA4, etc.). Handle authentication, rate limiting, pagination, error recovery, and schema changes.

2. **ETL pipeline:** Extract data from sources, transform it, and load it into your RAG pipeline. Schedule syncs, handle failures, monitor data freshness.

3. **Chunking strategy:** Split documents and records into chunks optimized for retrieval. Tune chunk size, overlap, and metadata preservation for each data type.

4. **Embedding pipeline:** Generate embeddings for every chunk using a model like OpenAI's text-embedding-3-large. Store them in a vector database (Pinecone, Weaviate, etc.).

5. **Retrieval logic:** Implement hybrid search, reranking, filtering, and relevance scoring. Tune for precision and recall.

6. **Prompt engineering:** Build prompts that effectively incorporate retrieved context and produce accurate answers.

7. **Monitoring and maintenance:** Track performance, fix breaking API changes, handle schema drift, update embeddings when data changes.

**Total engineering effort:** 3-6 months for a basic system; 12+ months for production-grade, multi-source RAG.

## What CorpusIQ Provides

1. **Pre-built MCP connectors:** 40+ data sources with OAuth authentication. Connect in one click.

2. **No ETL warehouse:** Queries run against live APIs without building a replicated raw-data pipeline. Scoped operational logs follow the published retention schedule.

3. **No chunking/embedding needed:** CorpusIQ doesn't use vector search for structured data. It makes typed API calls that return exact, structured results.

4. **No retrieval tuning:** The AI assistant constructs precise API queries based on user questions. No similarity threshold, no top-k tuning, no relevance scoring.

5. **No prompt engineering:** CorpusIQ's MCP tools are self-describing. The AI understands what each tool does and how to use it  --  no custom prompt templates needed.

6. **Managed maintenance:** CorpusIQ handles API changes, schema updates, and authentication. You get continuous improvement without engineering effort.

**Total setup time:** 2 minutes per data source.

## Quick Comparison

| Aspect | Custom RAG | CorpusIQ |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| **Time to First Query** | 3-12 months | 2 minutes |
| **Engineering Required** | Senior ML/Data engineers | None |
| **Data Sources** | Whatever you build | 40+ pre-built |
| **Query Accuracy** | Approximate (similarity search) | Exact (API calls) |
| **Data Freshness** | Batch-dependent | Real-time (live API) |
| **Aggregations** | Difficult (post-retrieval) | Native (API-level) |
| **Maintenance** | Your team's responsibility | Fully managed |
| **Cost (Year 1)** | $300K-800K (engineering + infra) | $600-2,400/seat |
| **Customizability** | Unlimited | Constrained by connector capabilities |
| **Scalability** | Your infrastructure | Managed platform |

## When Custom RAG Makes Sense

- **Unique data formats:** If your data is in a proprietary format or unusual structure that no connector handles, custom RAG may be necessary.

- **Document-heavy use cases:** For searching through thousands of PDFs, contracts, or legal documents, custom RAG with sophisticated chunking and retrieval is often required.

- **Full control requirements:** If you need to control every aspect of the pipeline for regulatory or competitive reasons, building in-house may be the right call.

- **Novel AI research:** If you're pushing the boundaries of RAG techniques, you'll need a custom implementation.

## When CorpusIQ Makes Sense

- **Standard business data:** CRM, accounting, analytics, marketing, payments  --  data from common business tools. CorpusIQ has connectors for these.

- **Speed matters:** You need AI-powered business intelligence this week, not next year.

- **Limited engineering resources:** Your team should be building product, not maintaining data pipelines.

- **Business user self-service:** Non-technical users need to query data without involving the data team.

- **Cost sensitivity:** The build cost for custom RAG is massive; CorpusIQ's per-seat pricing is negligible by comparison.

## The True Cost of Building RAG

Let's be honest about what custom RAG costs:

| Component | Annual Cost |
|-----------|-------------|
| 2 Senior Engineers (partial allocation) | $150,000-250,000 |
| Vector database (Pinecone/Weaviate) | $8,400-50,000 |
| Embedding API costs | $5,000-50,000 |
| ETL/Data pipeline infrastructure | $10,000-40,000 |
| DevOps and monitoring | $20,000-50,000 |
| Ongoing maintenance | $50,000-100,000 |
| **Total Annual** | **$243,400-540,000** |

Versus CorpusIQ: $600-2,400/year per user for the same data access  --  with real-time accuracy instead of batch staleness.

## FAQ

**Q: Can CorpusIQ handle unstructured documents like PDFs?**  
A: CorpusIQ focuses on structured business data from APIs. For document search, you may still need a vector database or enterprise search tool. Many organizations use both.

**Q: What if I need a data source CorpusIQ doesn't support?**  
A: CorpusIQ's connector library is growing. For unsupported sources, you can request new connectors or use CorpusIQ alongside custom integrations for those specific sources.

**Q: Does CorpusIQ use RAG internally?**  
A: No. CorpusIQ uses MCP  --  a protocol for structured tool calls. It doesn't embed data, chunk documents, or perform vector similarity search for structured business queries.

**Q: Can I customize how CorpusIQ queries my data?**  
A: CorpusIQ connectors expose predefined tools based on each source's API. You don't customize the query logic, but the AI can compose tools in creative ways to answer complex questions.

**Q: Is the quality as good as a custom-built system?**  
A: For structured business data queries, CorpusIQ's exact API calls are more accurate than approximate vector search. For document-heavy use cases, custom RAG may be more appropriate.

**Q: How do I handle data that changes frequently?**  
A: CorpusIQ queries live APIs  --  data is always current. Custom RAG requires re-indexing to stay fresh, which adds cost and complexity.

**Q: What about data privacy?**  
A: CorpusIQ uses read-only access for direct MCP live retrieval. It does not retain raw customer files or full connector response payloads; operational logs retain query text, per-user tool-call metadata, and bounded outcome summaries for up to 30 days.

**Q: Can I extend CorpusIQ with custom logic?**  
A: CorpusIQ is a managed platform. For custom logic, you can combine CorpusIQ (for data access) with a framework like LangChain (for custom application logic).
