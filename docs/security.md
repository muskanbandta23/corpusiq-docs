# Security

CorpusIQ is designed with data privacy as a foundational principle. This page documents the technical and organizational measures applied to protect user data. CorpusIQ LLC, Scottsdale, Arizona. Last updated: March 24, 2026.

## Certifications & Compliance

| Standard | Status |
|----------|--------|
| **CASA Tier 2** | Certified by DEKRA  --  OWASP Top 10 Verified |
| **SOC 2** | Aligned  --  formal certification is not claimed; controls are reviewed quarterly |
| **GDPR** | Aligned  --  data minimization, user consent, deletion rights |
| **Encryption** | AES-256 at rest, TLS 1.3 in transit |
| **Access Model** | Read-only external-source retrieval; explicit CorpusIQ control-plane writes are separately annotated |

## 1. Product Scope

**Sources:** Gmail, Google Drive, OneDrive, Dropbox, Outlook, Shopify, QuickBooks, HubSpot, Google Analytics, Google Ads, Meta Ads, YouTube, TikTok, eBay, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, and more. User-authorized only. No device agents. No browser extensions.

**Outputs:** In-chat answers, ranked references, and optional deep search results.

**Storage:** Direct MCP connector requests use live retrieval and do not build embeddings or file indexes. Optional indexed-search features use embeddings and minimal metadata. No raw file bodies are retained.

**Controls:** Per-user namespace, connector revocation, privacy-request handling, and structured audit logging. The Azure Log Analytics workspace retains operational logs for 30 days.

## 2. Data Inventory and Flow

CorpusIQ sits between your tools and the AI assistant. Read-only on one side. Source-backed answers on the other. Every step is logged.

| Data Class | Examples | Encryption | Retention |
|------------|----------|------------|-----------|
| Account | Email, OAuth subject | AES-256 at rest | Until account deletion |
| Optional indexed search | Embeddings, chunk IDs | AES-256 at rest | Until connector revocation or account deletion |
| Operational MCP query logs | Query text, tool metadata, bounded outcome summaries | AES-256 at rest | Up to 30 days |


- **Encrypted retrieval:** Data is encrypted in transit and at rest, scoped per user.
- **User-scoped isolation:** Each account operates in a separate namespace with no cross-access.
- **Scoped MCP logging:** Direct MCP does not retain raw customer files or full connector response payloads. Query text, tool-call metadata, and bounded outcome summaries are kept in operational logs for up to 30 days.

## 3. Security Controls

### Transport
TLS 1.3 only, HSTS, forward secrecy.

### Encryption at Rest
AES-256, managed keys, key rotation every 90 days.

### Network
Private subnets, deny-by-default, WAF and rate limits on all public endpoints.

### Access
External-source connectors use the documented retrieval scopes and do not write back to vendor systems. Explicit CorpusIQ control-plane tools that mutate user-declared CorpusIQ state are separately annotated. Vendor scopes remain visible on the OAuth authorization screen during connection setup.

### Authentication
API tokens have 60-minute expiry with server-side refresh detection. Tokens are never embedded in client-side code  --  server-side usage only. Disconnect commits an inactive state before credential cleanup; cleanup failures are surfaced for retry.

### Webhook Security
CorpusIQ does not currently publish a customer-facing webhook event contract. Event schemas, authentication, and delivery guarantees will be documented only after their production routes are verified.

## 4. Privacy and Lawful Basis

CorpusIQ processes data under the lawful basis of user consent and legitimate interest (service provision):

- **Data Minimization:** Only data necessary to answer a query is retrieved
- **Purpose Limitation:** Retrieved records fulfill the user's request; retained operational metadata supports service security, reliability, and compliance under the published schedule
- **No Data Sale:** CorpusIQ does not sell or monetize user data; scoped data is shared only with processors required to fulfill the request
- **No CorpusIQ Model Training:** CorpusIQ does not use customer data to train models; conversation handling follows the selected AI provider's plan and settings
- **No Background Collection:** Every API call to a connected tool is triggered by an explicit user query. There is no periodic syncing or scheduled polling.

## 5. Retention and Deletion

1. A query is received and routed to the separately named operations required for the request
2. Results are fetched from connected tools in real time
3. Direct MCP requests return the result without building embeddings or file indexes; optional indexed search separately retains embeddings and minimal metadata
4. Optional indexed-search features may retain embeddings and minimal metadata while the connector remains active

To request deletion of account data, contact privacy@corpusiq.io. CorpusIQ responds to privacy requests within 30 days. Operational MCP query logs remain subject to the 30-day Azure Log Analytics retention window.

## 6. Subprocessors

Infrastructure: Microsoft Azure (US-based). Residency requirements must be validated against the complete customer-specific processing path, including source providers, selected AI clients, logs, and backups.

## 7. Incident Response

- Monitoring and alerting on all production systems
- Defined incident classification and escalation paths
- Post-incident reviews with corrective actions
- User notification for confirmed data exposure events

## 8. Annual Reviews and Audits

- SOC 2 readiness program with quarterly control checks
- Independent pen-testing at least annually
- OWASP Top 10 verified (DEKRA CASA Tier 2 assessment)
- Regular vulnerability scanning and dependency audits

## 9. User Data Rights

Users can:
- Revoke OAuth tokens at any time via account settings
- Request deletion of account data by contacting privacy@corpusiq.io
- Request a data inventory by contacting privacy@corpusiq.io
- Export account data via the dashboard

## 10. Public API and Webhooks

- REST API at `https://mcp2.corpusiq.io/mcp`
- Bearer token authentication with 60-minute expiry
- Rate-limited endpoints with documented quotas
- No public webhook event contract is currently published

## 11. Reporting Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability, report to security@corpusiq.io. We follow a coordinated disclosure process and aim to acknowledge reports within 24 hours. Please do not publicly disclose before we have had an opportunity to address them.
