# How to Connect Stripe to ChatGPT with CorpusIQ MCP

Your **Stripe** account holds critical business data  --  but accessing insights usually means logging in, navigating dashboards, and running manual reports. **Connecting Stripe to ChatGPT through CorpusIQ MCP** eliminates all that friction. Once connected via a secure OAuth flow, ChatGPT can query your live Stripe data directly  --  you ask questions in plain English, and get cited answers drawn from your actual account, not outdated exports or screenshots.

Once connected, ChatGPT can query your live Stripe data  --  charges, customers, payouts, balance transactions, refunds, and disputes. You ask questions in plain English and get cited answers from your Stripe account in real time.

This page covers the connection architecture, what you can ask, reconciliation use cases, security, and how MCP compares to direct Stripe API integration.

## FAQ: Common Questions

<details>
<summary><strong>What payment questions can I ask ChatGPT about Stripe?</strong></summary>

Revenue questions: "What was our Stripe revenue this month?", "Show me revenue by day for the last 30 days." Customer questions: "Who are our top 10 customers by total charges?", "Show me all customers who churned this quarter." Payout questions: "What payouts did we receive last week?", "Which payout included charge X?" Refund questions: "What's our refund rate this month?", "Show me all refunds over $100." Dispute questions: "Do we have any open disputes?", "What's our dispute win rate?" Balance questions: "What's our current Stripe balance?", "How much is available vs. pending?"
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How does the connection work?</strong></summary>

CorpusIQ connects to your Stripe account via a restricted API key with read-only permissions. You create the key in your Stripe Dashboard, paste it into CorpusIQ, then connect the CorpusIQ MCP server to ChatGPT. ChatGPT discovers the available Stripe tools and calls them when you ask a payment question. The connection is direct, secure, and real-time.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Is the connection read-only?</strong></summary>

Yes. You create a Stripe restricted API key with only read permissions  --  specifically, read access to charges, customers, payouts, balance, refunds, and disputes. ChatGPT can query your payment data but cannot create charges, issue refunds, modify customers, or change anything in your Stripe account. The read-only guarantee is enforced by the Stripe API key permissions themselves.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What Stripe data can ChatGPT access?</strong></summary>

Charges with amounts, status, customer, and metadata. Customers with email, name, description, and charge history. Payouts with amounts, status, arrival date, and destination bank details. Balance transactions with types, amounts, and fees. Refunds with amounts, reasons, and associated charges. Disputes with amounts, reasons, status, and evidence deadlines. Current balance with available and pending amounts.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can ChatGPT reconcile Stripe data with accounting systems?</strong></summary>

Yes  --  reconciliation is one of the strongest use cases. "Does this Stripe payout match what QuickBooks shows?" "Show me Stripe charges that don't have corresponding QuickBooks invoices." "What fees did Stripe deduct from our last payout?" These cross-source reconciliation questions combine Stripe data with QuickBooks data in one ChatGPT response. See our [Stripe connector reference](connect-stripe-to-chatgpt.md) for reconciliation-specific tooling.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How is this different from the Stripe Dashboard?</strong></summary>

The Stripe Dashboard is purpose-built for payment operations  --  processing charges, managing disputes, configuring payment methods. It's essential for those tasks. But for analytics and Q&A, the Dashboard requires navigating multiple views. With ChatGPT, you ask one question and get an answer that may span charges, customers, payouts, and disputes  --  data that would require switching between four different Dashboard sections.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I query Stripe data alongside other payment processors?</strong></summary>

Yes. If you also use Shopify Payments, PayPal, or other processors, you can connect those to CorpusIQ and ask questions that span payment systems. "Compare Stripe revenue with Shopify Payments revenue this month" is a single question across multiple platforms  --  something no single payment processor's dashboard can do.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What about PCI compliance?</strong></summary>

Stripe handles all PCI compliance at the payment processing level. CorpusIQ only accesses non-PCI data  --  charge amounts, customer metadata, payout information. No card numbers, no CVV codes, no sensitive payment credentials. The restricted API key you create cannot access PCI-scoped data. Your compliance posture is unchanged by connecting Stripe to ChatGPT.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How does this handle multi-currency Stripe accounts?</strong></summary>

Stripe supports multiple currencies. CorpusIQ retrieves charge data in the currency of each transaction, with the presentment amount and currency. ChatGPT can present amounts in their original currencies and calculate conversions if needed. If your Stripe account has a default settlement currency, that's reflected in payout data.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I analyze Stripe fees?</strong></summary>

Yes. Balance transactions include Stripe fees on each charge. "What were our total Stripe fees this month?" "Show me fees as a percentage of revenue." "Which payment methods have the highest fee rates?" Fee analysis that would require exporting CSV data becomes a natural language question.
</details>

## How It Works

1. **Create a Stripe restricted API key.** In your Stripe Dashboard, create a new restricted key with read-only permissions for charges, customers, payouts, balance, refunds, and disputes.

2. **Connect Stripe to CorpusIQ.** In your CorpusIQ dashboard, click Connections → Stripe → paste your restricted API key. CorpusIQ validates the key and confirms which permissions are available.

3. **Connect CorpusIQ to ChatGPT.** Add the CorpusIQ MCP server. ChatGPT discovers tools for listing charges, customers, payouts, balance transactions, refunds, disputes, and getting your current balance.

4. **Ask payment questions.** ChatGPT determines which Stripe tools to call based on your question and returns cited answers from live data.

5. **Reconcile across systems.** Ask questions that combine Stripe with QuickBooks, Shopify, or other connected tools for cross-source reconciliation.

No API library to install. No webhooks to configure. No data warehouse to maintain.

## Benefits

**Instant payment visibility.** "What's our Stripe revenue today?" replaces logging in, navigating to payments, filtering by date, and mentally summing. One question. One answer. Seconds.

**Proactive dispute management.** "Any new disputes this week?" "Which disputes need evidence submitted in the next 48 hours?" Catch disputes before they become chargebacks  --  without manually monitoring the Stripe Dashboard.

**Automated reconciliation.** "Match this week's Stripe payouts against QuickBooks deposits." "Show me any Stripe charges from this month that don't have a corresponding invoice in QuickBooks." Reconciliation that normally takes hours of manual comparison becomes a ChatGPT question.

**Customer payment analysis.** "Show me customers whose payment volume dropped by more than 50% this quarter compared to last." "Which customers have the highest refund rate?" Payment behavior analysis that would require SQL queries in a data warehouse becomes conversational.

**Fee optimization.** "What payment methods have the highest fees relative to volume?" "Show me our effective Stripe fee rate month over month." Identify fee optimization opportunities without manual spreadsheet analysis.

## Use Cases

### Daily Revenue Monitoring

"Show me Stripe revenue, refunds, and net revenue for yesterday." Start every day with a payment pulse  --  no Dashboard login needed.

### Payout Reconciliation

"Show me the last 5 payouts with their balance transactions." "Which charges are included in Payout X?" "What's the total fee deducted from our last payout?" Payout reconciliation that's automatic instead of manual.

### Dispute Management

"List all open disputes with amounts, reasons, and evidence deadlines." "What's our dispute rate over the last 90 days?" "Which products or services have the highest dispute rate?" Manage disputes proactively with live data.

### Customer LTV Analysis

"Show me my top 20 customers by total Stripe charges." "What's the average customer lifetime value based on Stripe charge data?" "Which customers have been with us the longest based on first charge date?" Customer value analysis from payment data.

### Cross-Source Financial Reconciliation

"Does this month's Stripe revenue match this month's QuickBooks revenue?" "Show me Shopify orders that were paid via Stripe but don't appear in the Stripe charge list." Cross-source reconciliation that catches discrepancies before month-end close. See our [MCP for Finance guide](mcp-for-finance.md) for more financial reconciliation patterns.

## Security: Read-Only by API Key Design

The Stripe integration's security model is enforced by Stripe's own permission system:

- **Restricted API Key.** You create a key in Stripe with only the specific read permissions needed. No write permissions, no admin access. If the key is ever compromised, its scope is limited to reading the specific Stripe resources you granted.
- **No PCI Data.** The restricted key cannot access card numbers, bank account details, or other PCI-sensitive information. CorpusIQ never touches payment credentials.
- **Scoped direct-MCP retention.** CorpusIQ uses read-only access for direct MCP live retrieval. It does not retain raw customer files or full connector response payloads; operational logs retain query text, per-user tool-call metadata, and bounded outcome summaries for up to 30 days.
- **TLS 1.3 Encryption.** All data in transit is encrypted.
- **Key Rotation.** You can rotate the API key at any time from your Stripe Dashboard. Old keys are immediately invalidated.

For finance teams in regulated industries, Stripe remains the authoritative source. CorpusIQ retrieves permitted payment records through direct MCP; the retention classes and lifecycles described above still apply.

## Comparison: MCP vs. Direct Stripe API Integration

| Aspect | Direct API Integration | CorpusIQ MCP |
|--------|----------------------|--------------|
| **Setup** | Stripe SDK, API client, pagination, webhook handling | Create restricted key, paste it, done |
| **Query interface** | REST endpoints with JSON parameters | Natural language |
| **Pagination** | Must implement cursor-based pagination for lists | Handled automatically |
| **Multi-resource queries** | Multiple API calls with manual join logic | One question, automatic multi-tool orchestration |
| **Reconciliation** | Build custom logic to compare Stripe with QuickBooks/Shopify | Cross-source queries built-in |
| **Balance transactions** | Complex pagination through ledger entries | Automatic aggregation |
| **Maintenance** | API version updates, SDK upgrades | CorpusIQ handles all updates |

Direct API integration is appropriate for custom payment flows, Stripe Connect platforms, and automated payment operations. For payment analytics, reconciliation, and Q&A, MCP provides the same data access with zero code and zero ongoing maintenance.
