# How to Build an Executive AI Dashboard

## The Problem

Executives need a clear, real-time view of business performance. Traditional dashboards require months of BI development, depend on stale warehouse data, and can only answer the questions they were built for. When a board member asks "How does our customer acquisition cost trend against pipeline growth?" the dashboard likely doesn't have that view  --  and building it takes days.

## The Solution

An AI-powered executive dashboard built with CorpusIQ provides instant answers to any business question  --  drawing from live data across all your systems. No dashboards to build. No reports to schedule. Just ask and get answers.

## What You'll Need

- CorpusIQ account
- MCP-compatible AI assistant
- Connected business data sources (minimum: CRM + Accounting + Analytics)
- List of key executive questions

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Identify Your Executive KPIs

Define the metrics that matter to your leadership team:

| KPI Category | Key Metrics | Data Source |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Revenue** | MRR/ARR, revenue growth, revenue by product | QuickBooks, Stripe |
| **Sales** | Pipeline value, win rate, avg deal size, sales cycle | HubSpot |
| **Marketing** | CAC, ROAS, conversion rate, traffic | GA4, Google Ads, Meta Ads |
| **Customer** | Churn rate, NPS, LTV, active accounts | HubSpot, Stripe |
| **Financial** | Gross margin, burn rate, runway, cash position | QuickBooks, Stripe |
| **Operations** | Support tickets, resolution time, SLAs | HubSpot, Zendesk |

### Step 2: Connect ALL Executive Data Sources

For a complete executive dashboard, connect:

1. **CRM (HubSpot/Salesforce):** Pipeline, deals, customer health
2. **Accounting (QuickBooks/Xero):** Revenue, expenses, P&L
3. **Payments (Stripe):** Cash collected, refunds, disputes
4. **Web Analytics (GA4):** Traffic, conversions, user behavior
5. **Advertising (Google Ads, Meta Ads, LinkedIn Ads):** Spend, ROAS, CPA
6. **Email Marketing (Klaviyo/Mailchimp):** Campaign performance, list growth
7. **Communication (Slack):** Team activity, key discussions

### Step 3: Create Your Executive Question Set

Build a library of high-impact executive questions:

**Weekly Pulse:**
```
"Give me this week's business pulse: revenue closed, new pipeline created,
website traffic, ad spend, and cash position  --  compared to last week"
```

**Monthly Business Review:**
```
"Full monthly business review: revenue by product line, pipeline health,
customer acquisition cost by channel, churn rate, gross margin, and team 
headcount  --  with month-over-month and year-over-year comparisons"
```

**Board Meeting Prep:**
```
"Prepare board-ready summary: Q2 revenue vs plan, pipeline coverage ratio,
top 5 customers by revenue, burn rate and runway, key risks (deals at risk,
overdue invoices, customer churn signals)"
```

**Investor Update:**
```
"Investor metrics: MRR growth rate, net revenue retention, CAC payback period,
gross margin trend (6 months), and cash runway in months"
```

**Risk Assessment:**
```
"Identify business risks: deals stuck >30 days, customers with declining usage,
overdue invoices >60 days, campaigns with ROAS below target"
```

### Step 4: Configure Your Dashboard Interface

Your "dashboard" is your AI assistant. Set it up for executive use:

1. **Pin key queries** as saved prompts for one-click access
2. **Set up a dedicated channel** (Slack integration, shared ChatGPT thread) for executive queries
3. **Create query shortcuts**  --  numbered or named queries that anyone can invoke
4. **Enable mobile access**  --  executives can ask questions from their phone

### Step 5: Establish a Cadence

| Cadence | Query Set | Purpose |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| **Daily** | Revenue, pipeline, cash | Morning business pulse |
| **Weekly** | Full KPI set + comparisons | Team meeting prep |
| **Monthly** | Detailed breakdowns + trends | Board/investor reporting |
| **Ad-Hoc** | Any question, any time | Decision support |

## Example Executive Query Output

**Query:** "Executive summary for the board meeting tomorrow."

**AI Response:**
```
BOARD MEETING SUMMARY  --  June 16, 2026
Data as of: June 16, 2026, 8:45 AM (live)

REVENUE & GROWTH
• Q2 Revenue (to date): $1,580,000 (+27.4% vs Q1, +42% YoY)
• MRR: $527,000 (up from $415,000 last quarter)
• Top Product: Enterprise Platform ($680,000, 43% of revenue)

SALES PIPELINE
• Current Pipeline: $3,200,000 across 82 deals
• Pipeline Coverage: 2.0x quarterly target
• Q2 Closed: $1,580,000 (91 deals, 38% win rate)
• At-Risk Deals: 7 deals worth $245,000 (stuck >30 days)

CUSTOMER HEALTH
• Total Active Customers: 340 (+12% QoQ)
• Logo Churn: 2.1% (below 3% target)
• Net Revenue Retention: 118% (above 110% target)
• NPS: 62 (up from 58)

MARKETING EFFICIENCY
• CAC: $420 (down from $510 last quarter)
• Blended ROAS: 4.2x (Google: 5.1x, Meta: 3.8x, LinkedIn: 2.9x)
• Marketing-Sourced Pipeline: 38% of total

FINANCIAL HEALTH
• Gross Margin: 68% (target: 65%+)
• Burn Rate: $180,000/month
• Cash Position: $1,240,000
• Runway: 6.9 months (target: 12+ months)

KEY RISKS
⚠️ Runway at 6.9 months  --  below 12-month target
⚠️ 7 deals at risk ($245,000)  --  stalled in negotiation
⚠️ Top 3 customers represent 28% of revenue  --  concentration risk
```

## CorpusIQ's Role

CorpusIQ powers the executive AI dashboard by:

1. **Connecting all executive data sources** through one MCP endpoint
2. **Querying live data**  --  every answer reflects current business state
3. **Orchestrating cross-source analysis**  --  revenue from accounting, pipeline from CRM, spend from ads
4. **Enabling natural language**  --  no SQL, no dashboard builder, no BI training
5. **Supporting mobile/anywhere access**  --  ask questions from any device
6. **Scaling with your business**  --  add new sources as you grow

## FAQ

**Q: How is this different from a Tableau or Power BI dashboard?**  
A: Traditional dashboards show predefined views. This answers ANY question in real time from live data. It's a dashboard with infinite flexibility.

**Q: Can multiple executives use it simultaneously?**  
A: Yes. Each executive can have their own CorpusIQ account or share a team account.

**Q: How secure is executive data?**  
A: CorpusIQ external-source retrieval is read-only and inherits source permissions. Financial data in QuickBooks is only visible to users authorized in QuickBooks. Separately annotated CorpusIQ control-plane tools operate on user-declared CorpusIQ state.

**Q: Can I get alerts when metrics cross thresholds?**  
A: Not natively  --  CorpusIQ is query-on-demand. You can set up reminders to check key metrics at regular intervals.

**Q: How do I share the dashboard with board members?**  
A: Copy the AI's response into your board deck or share the query so board members can ask it themselves (if they have access).

**Q: What if our metrics are defined differently across systems?**  
A: Document which source is authoritative for which metric. CorpusIQ queries sources as-is; it doesn't reconcile definitions.

**Q: How often should I refresh metrics?**  
A: As often as decisions require. Data is live  --  ask whenever you need current numbers.

**Q: Can I export to PowerPoint or PDF?**  
A: Copy the AI's structured response into your presentation tool. Direct export depends on the AI client.
