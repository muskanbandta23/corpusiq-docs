# Connect Notion to Claude: Your Wiki as an AI Knowledge Base

Notion has become the de facto knowledge management platform for modern teams  --  housing everything from company wikis and product specs to project trackers and meeting notes. But as Notion workspaces grow, finding specific information becomes harder. Connecting Notion to Claude via CorpusIQ's MCP platform transforms your Notion workspace into an AI-queryable knowledge base.

Ask Claude "What's our Q3 product roadmap?", "Find the latest design specs for the checkout flow", or "What decisions were made in last week's engineering all-hands?" and Claude will search your Notion pages and databases to deliver accurate, sourced answers  --  no manual searching required.

## Why Connect Notion to Claude?

Notion is where your company's written knowledge lives. But Notion's search, while functional, is limited to keyword matching and doesn't understand context, intent, or semantic meaning. Claude brings AI-powered search and synthesis to your entire Notion workspace.

**Key benefits:**

- **Semantic knowledge retrieval.** Ask complex questions and Claude finds relevant Notion pages even when keywords don't match.
- **Cross-document synthesis.** "Compare our Q2 and Q3 product strategy docs"  --  Claude reads multiple pages and synthesizes a response.
- **Database intelligence.** Query structured Notion databases  --  project trackers, OKRs, CRM data  --  in natural language.
- **Onboarding acceleration.** New hires can ask Claude about company policies, processes, and documentation instead of searching through dozens of pages.
- **Meeting context retrieval.** "What were the action items from the last marketing team meeting?"  --  Claude finds and summarizes the relevant notes.
- **Always up to date.** Every query searches live Notion data  --  no stale exports or outdated cached versions.

## How It Works

1. **Connect Notion** using a Notion Internal Integration Token with read access to your workspace.
2. **Ask Claude** any question about your company's documentation or data.
3. **CorpusIQ searches** Notion's API  --  pages, databases, and blocks  --  for relevant content.
4. **Claude synthesizes** the results into a coherent answer with citations to source pages.

## Setup Steps

1. In Notion, go to **Settings & Members → Integrations** and create a new Internal Integration.
2. Grant the integration **read content** permissions.
3. **Share specific pages or databases** with the integration (Notion requires explicit sharing).
4. In CorpusIQ, go to **Connectors** and select **Notion**.
5. Enter your **Integration Token**.
6. Start asking Claude about your Notion content.

## Example Claude Queries

**Documentation & Knowledge Base:**
- "What's our remote work policy?"
- "Show me our employee onboarding checklist."
- "What's the process for submitting a security review?"
- "Find our brand guidelines  --  specifically the color palette section."

**Product & Engineering:**
- "What's the current status of the mobile app redesign?"
- "Show me the API documentation for the payments endpoint."
- "What were the key decisions from the architecture review meeting?"
- "List all open bugs from the QA database sorted by severity."

**Project Management:**
- "What's the status of all Q3 OKRs?"
- "Show me tasks assigned to [team member] across all project databases."
- "Which projects are behind schedule?"

**HR & Operations:**
- "What's our expense reimbursement policy?"
- "Find the org chart and list all direct reports under [manager]."
- "What holidays are observed this year?"

**Cross-Source:**
- "Cross-reference our Notion product roadmap with Jira tickets." (requires Jira)
- "Compare our documented sales process in Notion with actual HubSpot pipeline stages." (requires HubSpot)

## Security

- **Page-level access control.** Claude can only access pages and databases you've explicitly shared with the integration.
- **Read-only token.** Claude can read content but can never create, update, or delete Notion pages.
- **Scoped direct-MCP retention.** CorpusIQ uses read-only access for direct MCP live retrieval. It does not retain raw customer files or full connector response payloads; operational logs retain query text, per-user tool-call metadata, and bounded outcome summaries for up to 30 days.
- **Token revocation.** Revoke the Notion integration token at any time.

## Comparison: MCP vs. Notion API Direct

| Aspect | CorpusIQ MCP | Notion API Direct |
|---|---|---|
| Setup | Token entry (5 minutes) | Developer integration required |
| Natural language | Yes  --  AI-powered search | No  --  REST API only |
| Semantic understanding | Claude's AI comprehension | Basic keyword/API filtering |
| Cross-source | Built-in | Custom development |
| Non-technical access | Anyone can query | Developers only |

## FAQ

**Q: Can Claude see all my Notion pages automatically?**
A: No. Notion requires explicit sharing. You must share specific pages or databases with the integration for Claude to access them.

**Q: Can Claude modify Notion content?**
A: No. The integration token is read-only.

**Q: Does this work with Notion databases?**
A: Yes. Claude can query structured Notion databases  --  project trackers, CRM systems, task lists  --  in natural language.

**Q: How does Claude handle large workspaces with thousands of pages?**
A: CorpusIQ uses Notion's search API to efficiently find relevant content. Claude processes only the most relevant results.

**Q: Can I restrict which team members can query Notion through Claude?**
A: The Notion integration token grants workspace-level access to shared pages. Any Claude user with access to the connection can query shared content.
