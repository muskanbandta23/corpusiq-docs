# How to Connect Shopify to ChatGPT with CorpusIQ MCP

Your **Shopify** account holds critical business data  --  but accessing insights usually means logging in, navigating dashboards, and running manual reports. **Connecting Shopify to ChatGPT through CorpusIQ MCP** eliminates all that friction. Once connected via a secure OAuth flow, ChatGPT can query your live Shopify data directly  --  you ask questions in plain English, and get cited answers drawn from your actual account, not outdated exports or screenshots.

Once connected, ChatGPT can query your live Shopify data directly. You ask questions in plain English. You get cited answers from your actual store  --  not outdated exports, not screenshots, not guesswork.

This page covers everything you need to know: how the connection works, what you can ask, security, setup, and why MCP is fundamentally different from direct API integration.

## FAQ: Common Questions

<details>
<summary><strong>What can I ask ChatGPT about my Shopify store once connected?</strong></summary>

You can ask about orders, revenue, products, customers, refunds, and store performance. Examples: "What was our Shopify revenue last week?", "Which products had the most refunds this month?", "Show me my top 10 customers by lifetime spend", "What's our AOV trend over the last 90 days?", "How many repeat buyers did we have in Q1?", "Which product variants are selling fastest?", "What's our refund rate by product category?"
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How does CorpusIQ connect Shopify to ChatGPT?</strong></summary>

CorpusIQ uses the Model Context Protocol (MCP)  --  an open standard for connecting AI assistants to data sources. You connect your Shopify store to CorpusIQ via OAuth (2 minutes, read-only), then connect the CorpusIQ MCP server to your ChatGPT account. ChatGPT discovers available tools at runtime and calls the right one when you ask a question. No code. No CSV exports. No API key management.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Is the connection read-only?</strong></summary>

Yes. CorpusIQ requests read-only external-source retrieval scopes from Shopify. ChatGPT can see orders, products, customers, and store analytics. It cannot create orders, modify products, issue refunds, change prices, or alter anything in your store. The worst that can happen is an incorrect answer  --  never an incorrect database update.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What Shopify data can ChatGPT access?</strong></summary>

Orders with line items, totals, and customer details. Products and variants. Customer profiles and order history. Refunds and discount codes applied. Store-level aggregates including total sales, AOV, and order counts for any date range. All of it is live  --  answers reflect the current state of your store, not a cached snapshot.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Do I need to export data or maintain a data warehouse?</strong></summary>

No. CorpusIQ queries your Shopify store directly through the Shopify API. There's no ETL pipeline, no data warehouse to maintain, no scheduled exports to configure. The connection is real-time  --  when you ask a question, the answer comes from live data.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How is this different from using Shopify's built-in analytics?</strong></summary>

Shopify's analytics are pre-built and limited to Shopify's own reporting views. With ChatGPT connected via CorpusIQ, you can ask ad-hoc questions that don't fit into a pre-built report. You can also combine Shopify data with data from other connected tools  --  compare Shopify revenue against Google Ads spend, or see how Klaviyo email campaigns correlate with order volume. The cross-source capability is something no single-platform dashboard can offer.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I use this with multiple Shopify stores?</strong></summary>

Yes. You can connect multiple Shopify stores to your CorpusIQ account. Each store's data is isolated, and you can specify which store to query in your questions  --  or let the AI pull data across stores for multi-brand analysis.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What permissions do I need to connect?</strong></summary>

You need a Shopify store on any plan, plus a store owner or staff account with permission to install apps. The connection takes about 2 minutes from start to finish.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Does this work with Shopify Plus?</strong></summary>

Yes. CorpusIQ works with all Shopify plans, including Shopify Plus. The OAuth scopes and API access are the same regardless of plan level. Shopify Plus merchants get the same read-only access with the same security guarantees.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How much does it cost?</strong></summary>

CorpusIQ offers a free 30-day trial that includes the Shopify connector. After the trial, pricing depends on your plan. Visit [corpusiq.io](https://www.corpusiq.io) for current pricing. There are no per-query charges, no data volume fees, and no hidden costs for the Shopify integration.
</details>

## How It Works

The architecture is straightforward. CorpusIQ acts as a secure MCP bridge between ChatGPT and your Shopify store. Here's the flow:

1. **Connect Shopify to CorpusIQ.** You authorize CorpusIQ to access your Shopify store via read-only external-source retrieval. This takes about 2 minutes  --  enter your store's myshopify.com domain, sign into Shopify, and approve the requested scopes.

2. **Connect CorpusIQ to ChatGPT.** In ChatGPT, you add the CorpusIQ MCP server as a connected app. ChatGPT discovers all your connected data sources automatically. See our [ChatGPT integration guide](chatgpt-integration.md) for step-by-step instructions.

3. **Ask questions.** ChatGPT receives your question, determines that it needs Shopify data, calls the appropriate MCP tool, and returns a cited answer from your live store.

4. **Follow up naturally.** Because MCP preserves conversational context, you can ask follow-up questions that build on previous answers. "Break that down by product category" works because the model knows what "that" refers to.

This architecture eliminates the traditional analytics pipeline  --  no data warehouse, no ETL, no scheduled exports. The connection is direct, secure, and real-time.

## Benefits of Connecting Shopify to ChatGPT

**Ad-hoc analytics without a data team.** The VP of Ecommerce, the marketing director, the finance lead  --  anyone who needs Shopify data can ask for it directly in ChatGPT. No SQL. No dashboard configuration. No waiting for a data analyst to build a report.

**Real-time decision support.** Traditional BI tools show you yesterday's data. With MCP, you ask about today's performance and get today's numbers. During a flash sale or promotional period, that real-time access is the difference between catching a trend early and reacting after it's over.

**Cross-source context.** Shopify data becomes more valuable when combined with data from other tools. "Did our Google Ads campaign drive more Shopify revenue than our email campaign?" is a single question that CorpusIQ answers by querying Shopify, Google Ads, and Klaviyo simultaneously. This cross-source capability is unique to MCP platforms like [CorpusIQ's multi-source MCP approach](benefits-of-mcp-for-business.md).

**Source-cited answers you can verify.** Every answer includes provenance  --  which connector provided the data, what query was executed, and when. If a number looks surprising, you can trace it back to the source. This auditability is essential for financial reporting and stakeholder communications.

**No infrastructure to maintain.** Unlike data warehouses that require schema management, ETL pipelines, and regular maintenance, the MCP approach has zero infrastructure overhead. Connect once and it works. If your Shopify data changes, answers change with it  --  automatically.

## Use Cases

### Ecommerce Performance Monitoring

Ask ChatGPT to monitor your store's key metrics daily. "What was yesterday's revenue compared to the same day last week?" "Which products sold out this weekend?" "Show me our refund rate for the last 30 days." Get a daily operational pulse without opening multiple dashboards.

### Customer Analysis

Understand your customer base conversationally. "Who are my top 20 customers by lifetime value?" "Which customers haven't purchased in over 90 days?" "Show me customers who bought Product X but not Product Y." These queries would require custom reports in Shopify  --  they're one question in ChatGPT.

### Inventory Management

Track product performance and inventory levels. "Which products have under 10 units in stock?" "What's our best-selling product this month by units?" "Show me products with zero sales in the last 60 days." Make restocking and discontinuation decisions with live data.

### Marketing Attribution

Combine Shopify data with marketing platform data for attribution analysis. "Which marketing channel drove the most first-time purchases this month?" "What's the AOV from Google Ads traffic vs. email traffic?" These cross-source questions are where [MCP's multi-source architecture](benefits-of-mcp-for-business.md) truly shines.

### Financial Reconciliation

Validate revenue numbers across platforms. "Does our Shopify revenue match what Stripe shows for the same period?" "Show me orders that were refunded but still appear as revenue." These reconciliation use cases save hours of manual data comparison.

## Security: Read-Only by Design

CorpusIQ's Shopify integration is read-only at every layer. The OAuth scopes requested from Shopify only include read permissions. The MCP server only exposes query tools  --  no mutation operations exist. Even if a query were somehow misrouted, no data can be modified.

For organizations with strict compliance requirements, CorpusIQ's security architecture is described in detail in our [security documentation](../security/). Key points:

- **OAuth 2.0** authentication  --  no shared credentials, no API keys stored in plaintext.
- **TLS 1.3** encryption in transit.
- **Scoped direct-MCP retention.** CorpusIQ uses read-only access for direct MCP live retrieval. It does not retain raw customer files or full connector response payloads; operational logs retain query text, per-user tool-call metadata, and bounded outcome summaries for up to 30 days.
- **Scoped access**  --  each connector requests only the permissions it needs, and you can verify exact scopes during authorization.

## Comparison: MCP vs. Direct Shopify API Integration

Building a direct Shopify API integration to ChatGPT requires significant engineering effort. Here's how the two approaches compare:

| Aspect | Direct API Integration | CorpusIQ MCP |
|--------|----------------------|--------------|
| **Setup time** | Days to weeks of development | 2 minutes |
| **Authentication** | Manual API key management, token rotation | OAuth 2.0 with automatic token management |
| **Query interface** | REST/GraphQL endpoints that require coding | Natural language  --  ask questions in plain English |
| **Multi-source queries** | Must build separate integrations for each service, then orchestrate | Combine Shopify with QuickBooks, GA4, Klaviyo, and more in one question |
| **Security** | Developer must implement read-only guards manually | Read-only by default, enforced at the OAuth and MCP layers |
| **Maintenance** | API version updates, schema changes, token rotation | CorpusIQ handles all maintenance and API updates |
| **Error handling** | Must code for rate limits, pagination, schema evolution | Built-in error handling and retry logic |

The direct API approach makes sense if you need custom write operations or deeply integrated workflows. For the vast majority of business users who need answers from their data, MCP is faster, safer, and cheaper to maintain.

## Comparison: MCP vs. Traditional BI Tools

Traditional business intelligence tools like Looker, Tableau, and Power BI require data warehousing, ETL pipelines, and report configuration. Connecting a new data source takes hours or days. Building a new report requires SQL or a visual query builder.

With MCP, connecting Shopify to ChatGPT takes 2 minutes, and every question is a new report  --  generated on the fly from live data. There's no data warehouse to maintain, no ETL to debug, and no dashboard to configure. For operational analytics, MCP is dramatically simpler.
