# How to Connect Stripe to Claude with CorpusIQ MCP

Stripe processes billions of dollars in payments, but the financial data it captures  --  charges, subscriptions, refunds, disputes, payouts  --  is often siloed in the Stripe Dashboard, inaccessible to team members who need it for reconciliation, customer support, and financial analysis. Connecting Stripe to Claude via CorpusIQ's MCP platform changes that.

Ask Claude "What was our subscription MRR last month?", "Show me all disputed charges from Q2", or "Which customers have the highest lifetime value?" and receive accurate, real-time answers drawn from your live Stripe data. Claude becomes your payment intelligence layer  --  no Stripe Dashboard required.

### Why Connect Stripe to Claude?

Stripe manages your revenue  --  and understanding that revenue means understanding the full payment lifecycle: charges, refunds, disputes, payouts, and subscription metrics. Claude gives you a natural language interface to all of it.

**Key benefits:**

- **MRR and subscription metrics in seconds.** Ask Claude "What's our monthly recurring revenue trend?" and get an instant answer with trend analysis.
- **Dispute and refund monitoring.** "How many chargebacks did we have this month and what was the total disputed amount?"  --  no manual report building.
- **Customer financial profiles.** "Show me the full payment history for [customer email]" for support and account management.
- **Payout reconciliation.** Match Stripe payouts to bank deposits or QuickBooks entries for financial close.
- **Revenue intelligence.** Combine Stripe revenue with Shopify orders, Google Analytics conversions, or Facebook Ads spend.
- **Read-only security.** API key with restricted permissions. Claude can query payment data but can never initiate charges, issue refunds, or modify customers.

### How It Works

1. **Connect Stripe** by providing a read-only restricted API key.
2. **Ask Claude** any payment-related question.
3. **CorpusIQ executes** Stripe API calls using your key  --  charges, customers, subscriptions, payouts, refunds, disputes, balance.
4. **Claude presents** the results with analysis, calculations, and actionable insights.

CorpusIQ uses read-only access for direct MCP live retrieval. It does not retain raw customer files or full connector response payloads; operational logs retain query text, per-user tool-call metadata, and bounded outcome summaries for up to 30 days.

### Setup Steps

1. Navigate to **Connectors** in CorpusIQ.
2. Select **Stripe** from the integration catalog.
3. **Create a restricted API key** in your Stripe Dashboard with read-only permissions for Charges, Customers, Subscriptions, Payouts, Balance, Refunds, and Disputes.
4. **Enter the key** in CorpusIQ.
5. Start asking Claude payment questions.

### Example Claude Queries

**Subscription Analytics:**
- "What's our MRR and how has it trended over the last 6 months?"
- "How many active subscriptions do we have, broken down by plan?"
- "What's our subscription churn rate this quarter?"
- "Show me customers on annual plans that are expiring in the next 30 days."

**Revenue & Payments:**
- "What was our total processed volume last month?"
- "Show me daily revenue for the last 30 days."
- "What's our average transaction size this year?"
- "Which payment methods are most common among our customers?"

**Refunds & Disputes:**
- "How many refunds did we process in Q2 and what was the total refunded amount?"
- "Show me all chargebacks with their current status."
- "What's our dispute win rate?"
- "Which products or services have the highest refund rates?"

**Payout Reconciliation:**
- "Show me all payouts from last month with their amounts and arrival dates."
- "Do our Stripe payouts match our QuickBooks deposits?" (requires QuickBooks)
- "What's our current Stripe balance  --  available vs. pending?"

**Customer Intelligence:**
- "Who are our top 20 customers by lifetime value?"
- "Show me customers with failed payments in the last 7 days."
- "What's the average customer lifetime by plan?"

### Security

- **Restricted API key.** Use a read-only Stripe key with only the permissions Claude needs.
- **No write access.** Claude can query but never charge, refund, or modify.
- **Scoped direct-MCP retention.** CorpusIQ uses read-only access for direct MCP live retrieval. It does not retain raw customer files or full connector response payloads; operational logs retain query text, per-user tool-call metadata, and bounded outcome summaries for up to 30 days.
- **Key encryption.** Your Stripe API key is encrypted at rest.

| Cross-source | Built-in (Stripe + QuickBooks + Shopify) | Custom development needed |
| Subscription metrics | Automatic MRR, churn calculations | Must build aggregation logic |
| Non-technical access | Anyone can query | Developers only |
