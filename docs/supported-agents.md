## Any MCP-Compatible Agent

CorpusIQ uses the standard Model Context Protocol. Any agent that supports MCP can connect:

1. Configure your agent with the MCP endpoint: `https://www.corpusiq.io/mcp/direct-connection`
2. Use the `http` transport for direct connections
3. Use `mcp-remote` for agents that require a local proxy
4. Complete the OAuth 2.0 device flow when prompted

**Verify your connection** by asking your agent: "What data sources are connected to CorpusIQ?"

Your agent should list all 36 available business data sources.

## Connection Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Agent can't find MCP server | Verify the URL: `https://www.corpusiq.io/mcp/direct-connection` |
| Authentication loop | Complete device verification at the provided URL |
| Tools not appearing | Run `tools/list` or restart your agent |
| Timeout errors | Check internet connection, retry with increased timeout |
| 403 Forbidden | Your account may need to be provisioned. Contact support. |

## Frequently Asked Questions

A: CorpusIQ has verified compatibility with Hermes (Nous Research), Claude Desktop (Anthropic), Cursor, Windsurf (Codeium), and Roo Code. Any MCP-compatible agent can connect using the standard endpoint.

**Q: How do I configure my agent to connect to CorpusIQ?**  
A: Add the CorpusIQ MCP endpoint (https://www.corpusiq.io/mcp/direct-connection) to your agent's MCP servers config. Use 'http' transport for direct connections or 'mcp-remote' for agents requiring a local proxy. See the config blocks for each agent above.
