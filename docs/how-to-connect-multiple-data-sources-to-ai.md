# How to Connect Multiple Data Sources to AI

## The Problem

Your business runs on multiple systems. HubSpot for CRM, QuickBooks for accounting, Stripe for payments, Google Analytics for web traffic, Google Ads for marketing spend, Slack for communication. Each tool provides valuable data  --  but in isolation. The real insights come from connecting the dots: How does marketing spend translate to pipeline? Which customers with open deals have overdue invoices? How does website traffic correlate with revenue?

Traditional approaches require data warehousing, ETL pipelines, and months of engineering. That's too slow, too expensive, and too complex for most teams.

## The Solution

CorpusIQ's MCP platform connects multiple data sources to AI simultaneously. One question can query five different tools, and the AI combines the results into a coherent answer  --  all in seconds, without building an ETL warehouse of raw customer files or full connector payloads.

## What You'll Need

- CorpusIQ account
- MCP-compatible AI assistant
- Multiple business data sources to connect (2+ recommended for full value)

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Map Your Data Landscape

Before connecting, identify which data sources matter most for your questions:

| Business Function | Recommended Sources |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Sales Intelligence** | HubSpot/Salesforce + Gmail + Slack |
| **Financial Intelligence** | QuickBooks + Stripe + HubSpot |
| **Marketing Intelligence** | GA4 + Google Ads + Meta Ads + HubSpot |
| **Customer Intelligence** | HubSpot + Stripe + Gmail + Intercom/Zendesk |
| **Executive Intelligence** | ALL of the above  --  unified business view |

### Step 2: Connect All Sources Through CorpusIQ

For each data source, the process is identical and takes under 60 seconds:

1. **Log in** to your CorpusIQ dashboard
2. **Click "Add Connector"** and select the source
3. **Authenticate** through the OAuth flow
4. **Repeat** for every source you want to connect

Connect in this order for the best initial experience:
1. CRM (HubSpot/Salesforce)  --  customer and pipeline data
2. Accounting (QuickBooks)  --  financial data
3. Payments (Stripe)  --  transaction data
4. Web Analytics (GA4)  --  traffic and conversion data
5. Advertising (Google Ads, Meta Ads)  --  marketing spend and performance
6. Communication (Gmail, Slack)  --  conversations and context

### Step 3: Configure Cross-Source Access

In your AI assistant:
1. Add your CorpusIQ MCP Server URL
2. The AI discovers ALL connected data sources as available tools
3. No additional configuration needed  --  the AI automatically determines which sources to query for each question

### Step 4: Master Cross-Source Questions

The real power is asking questions that span multiple sources. Here are the most valuable patterns:

**Revenue Attribution:**
```
"Compare our Google Ads and Meta Ads spend this month to GA4 revenue from 
paid channels, and show me which HubSpot deals came from those campaigns"
```
Sources queried: Google Ads, Meta Ads, GA4, HubSpot

**Customer Health Check:**
```
"Show me all customers with open HubSpot deals who have overdue QuickBooks 
invoices and haven't had a Gmail thread in the last 30 days"
```
Sources queried: HubSpot, QuickBooks, Gmail

**Marketing ROI:**
```
"For each Google Ads campaign this quarter, show me the spend, GA4 
conversions, and the total value of HubSpot deals associated with those campaigns"
```
Sources queried: Google Ads, GA4, HubSpot

**Executive Summary:**
```
"Give me a full business health check: Q2 revenue from QuickBooks, 
pipeline from HubSpot, website traffic from GA4, and cash position from Stripe"
```
Sources queried: QuickBooks, HubSpot, GA4, Stripe

### Step 5: Build a Question Library

Document your most valuable cross-source questions so your team can reuse them:

| Question | Sources | Use Case |
|----------|---------|----------|
| "Marketing spend vs pipeline generated" | Google Ads + HubSpot | Weekly marketing review |
| "Revenue vs cash collected" | QuickBooks + Stripe | Monthly financial close |
| "Customer activity health score" | HubSpot + Gmail + Slack | Account management |
| "Ad campaign ROAS by channel" | Google Ads + Meta Ads + GA4 | Marketing optimization |

## Example Cross-Source Result

**Query:** "Show me our business performance this month across sales, marketing, and finance."

**AI Response:**
```

SALES (HubSpot):
- New Deals Created: 47 ($890,000 total value)

## CorpusIQ's Role

CorpusIQ makes multi-source AI queries possible by:

1. **Unifying authentication**  --  one platform, one OAuth flow per source
2. **Parallel query execution**  --  hitting all relevant APIs simultaneously
3. **Structured data return**  --  typed, AI-ready JSON from every source
4. **Live data access**  --  no warehouse, no ETL, no batch windows
5. **Intelligent routing**  --  the AI chooses which sources to query based on the question

## FAQ

**Q: How many sources can I connect simultaneously?**  
A: All 40+ CorpusIQ connectors can be active at once. Your AI assistant can query any combination of them.

**Q: Does querying multiple sources slow down responses?**  
A: Minimally. CorpusIQ executes queries in parallel. A 5-source query typically completes in 3-8 seconds.

**Q: What if one source is down?**  
A: The AI will report that the source is unavailable and deliver results from the remaining sources. Partial answers are better than no answers.

**Q: Can I control which sources the AI queries?**  
A: Yes  --  specify in your question. "Using only HubSpot and QuickBooks, show me..."

**Q: Is there a limit on cross-source query complexity?**  
A: The limit is practical, not technical. Questions spanning 5-7 sources work well. Beyond that, results become harder to present coherently.

**Q: Do I need a data warehouse for cross-source queries?**  
A: No warehouse is required for direct MCP queries. CorpusIQ calls live APIs without retaining raw customer files or full connector response payloads; scoped operational logs may persist for up to 30 days.

**Q: How does the AI know which source has which data?**  
A: MCP tools are self-describing. Each connector advertises what it can do, and the AI maps your question to the right tools automatically.

**Q: Can I save multi-source query templates?**  
A: Save the question text in a document or note. The AI will run it fresh each time with live data.
